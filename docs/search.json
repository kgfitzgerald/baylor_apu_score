    "section": "",
    "text": "Please note that these material have not yet completed the required pedagogical and industry peer-reviews to become a published module on the SCORE Network. However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.\n\n\nData for a particular sport is often stored across numerous locations. For example, in NCAA Division I Softball, batting statistics for each season are typically stored in separate tables. (See for example the statistics hosted by https://d1softball.com/.)\nSuppose we are interested in tracking the statistics of players across multiple seasons. A common way to prep the data to do this is to use join statements to merge each seasons data into one table with one row per player (and columns associated with their different statistics for each season).\nThis module looks at some simple batting stats over two seasons through the use of joining functions for a small subset of NCAA Division 1 Softball players’ statistics for the 2021 and 2022 seasons. (This is only a small window of a much bigger dataset).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon completion of this module students should improve upon\n\nbeing able to join two data tables\nbeing able to anticipate (by sketching) the resulting data table prior to running the code to do so\nidentify situations where more than one key is needed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nFor R users, recall that six commonly used joining functions available through the dplyr package are, left, right, full, inner, semi, and anti. Additionally, other useful dplyr verbs for combining multiple tables of data include intersect, union, and setdiff. (These are called set operators. )\nFurther details regarding joins can be found at https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/two-table.html.\nTechnology requirement: The activity handout has optional components for students that can use technology to perform the joins. However, it is not a requirement to complete the main exercises. It is assumed that students will use R for the module, but a pair of databases (one in sqlite, the other in duckdb) are provided for students that prefer to use SQL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are four data tables associated with this module.\nTwo of them, batting2021 and batting2022, contain statistics for all Division 1 Softball player who played in the 2021 and/or 2022 season.\nThe other two, batting2021_subset and batting2022_subset, represent non-random samples taken the full data. These are displayed below.

    "text": "Please note that these material have not yet completed the required pedagogical and industry peer-reviews to become a published module on the SCORE Network. However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.\n\n\nData for a particular sport is often stored across numerous locations. For example, in NCAA Division I Softball, batting statistics for each season are typically stored in separate tables. (See for example the statistics hosted by https://d1softball.com/.)\nSuppose we are interested in tracking the statistics of players across multiple seasons. A common way to prep the data to do this is to use join statements to merge each seasons data into one table with one row per player (and columns associated with their different statistics for each season).\nThis module looks at some simple batting stats over two seasons through the use of joining functions for a small subset of NCAA Division 1 Softball players’ statistics for the 2021 and 2022 seasons. (This is only a small window of a much bigger dataset).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon completion of this module students should improve upon\n\nbeing able to join two data tables\nbeing able to anticipate (by sketching) the resulting data table prior to running the code to do so\nidentify situations where more than one key is needed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nFor R users, recall that six commonly used joining functions available through the dplyr package are, left, right, full, inner, semi, and anti. Additionally, other useful dplyr verbs for combining multiple tables of data include intersect, union, and setdiff. (These are called set operators. )\nFurther details regarding joins can be found at https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/two-table.html.\nTechnology requirement: The activity handout has optional components for students that can use technology to perform the joins. However, it is not a requirement to complete the main exercises. It is assumed that students will use R for the module, but a pair of databases (one in sqlite, the other in duckdb) are provided for students that prefer to use SQL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are four data tables associated with this module.\nTwo of them, batting2021 and batting2022, contain statistics for all Division 1 Softball player who played in the 2021 and/or 2022 season.\nThe other two, batting2021_subset and batting2022_subset, represent non-random samples taken the full data. These are displayed below.

However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.\n\n\nIn NASCAR, driver rating is a metric used to evaluate the performance of drivers in races. It provides a comprehensive assessment of a driver’s overall competitiveness, efficiency, and consistency during a race. The driver rating is based on several key performance factors and is designed to offer a more objective view of a driver’s abilities.

However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.\n\n\nThis module examines the goals and shots in two prominent lacrosse leagues: the Premier Lacrosse League (PLL) and the National Lacrosse League (NLL). The PLL and NLL are highly regarded professional lacrosse leagues that feature top-tier athletes from around the world.\nThe PLL is played in an outdoor setting, following the field lacrosse format. This style of lacrosse is characterized by its larger field size, typically 110 yards by 60 yards. Field lacrosse involves 10 players per team and promotes a style of play that emphasizes long passes, intricate plays, and individual skills. Founded in 2019, the PLL operates with a touring model where teams travel to different cities each weekend, bringing the sport to a wide audience and fostering a festival-like atmosphere at each event. The league’s modernized approach includes a strong emphasis on media presence and player engagement. The PLL features approximately 200 athletes across its teams.\nIn contrast, the NLL follows the box lacrosse format, which is played indoors on a smaller, enclosed field, generally 200 feet by 85 feet. Box lacrosse involves 6 players per team, and the gameplay is marked by frequent physical interactions, quick ball movements, and high-intensity transitions. Established in 1986, the NLL has a traditional franchise model with teams based in specific cities across the United States and Canada. This structure has cultivated strong local fan bases and deep community ties, contributing to the league’s longevity. The NLL features approximately 500 athletes, many of which also play in the PLL.\nThese data, from the 2021-2022 seasons, allow for an analysis of goal-scoring within these leagues to identify differences between indoor (NLL) and outdoor (PLL) play. By examining goals and shots, we aim to understand how the environment and format of the game influence offensive strategies and overall scoring trends in professional lacrosse.

    "text": "Please note that these material have not yet completed the required pedagogical and industry peer-reviews to become a published module on the SCORE Network. However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.\n\n\nWeightlifters may be inclined to track the specific ratio between flat dumbbell press and barbell bench press.\nA dumbbell is a short bar with equal weight on both sides designed to be held in the lifter’s hands. Flat dumbbell press is when the lifter lies on a flat bench with their arms positioned at roughly 45 degree angles, lifts two equal sized dumbbells, brings them back to the chest, and then keeps going.\nA barbell is similar in shape to a dumbbell, but is a longer, much heavier bar where multiple weighted plates can be placed on either side. Barbell bench press is when the lifter lies on a bench with the barbell positioned at their chest, lifts the barbell, and then brings it back down.\nThe ratio of flat dumbbell press to barbell bench press works to track how much someone is lifting two dumbbells compared to how much they are able to lift the weighted barbell. When calculating the ratio, it was multiplied by two in order to account for the total weight lifted when doing a flat dumbbell press, as there are two dumbbells that would have to be held by the lifter.\nAn example of this is as follows:\nSay Melissa is able to flat dumbbell press two 30 lbs dumbbells. The total amount she can flat dumbbell press is 60 lbs (one dumbbell for each arm). On barbell bench press, she can lift 75 lbs. Her ratio would be calculated by dividing flat dumbbell press by barbell bench press (60/75) which equals 0.8, meaning that Melissa can lift two dumbbells up to 80% as heavy as she can bench press the barbell.\nWhile both exercises predominately target the chest muscles, each can focus on different secondary muscle groups. Many weightlifters like to track this ratio to work towards specific strength goals and target any weakness in certain muscle groups1.\nFor example, if someone’s ratio is low (i.e. they can barbell bench press much more than they can flat dumbbell press), it highlights that they might want to work on targeting the secondary muscles used in flat dumbbell press. In this case, these muscles are usually referred to as the stabilizer muscles. This could mean they rely more on the barbell for their pressing strength and might benefit from incorporating more dumbbell exercises to improve muscle balance and stability.\nOn the flip side, if someone’s ratio is high, it might indicate strong stabilizer muscles and good overall balance. This could mean they have well-developed coordination and muscular control, potentially reducing the risk of injury and enhancing overall athletic performance. However, it might also suggest that their barbell press strength is relatively underdeveloped, implying a need to focus more on barbell training to ensure balanced muscle development or to increase their overall strength.\nFinally, a lifter might be interested in being close to the average ratio of dumbbell to barbell press because it indicates a balanced strength development. In particular, this can be useful if they are able to compare themselves to the average from a group of peers. Being close to the average suggests that their training regimen is effective in developing both primary pressing muscles and stabilizer muscles evenly. This balance can contribute to better overall performance, reduced injury risk, and a more well-rounded physique.\nThe data on the ratio between dumbbell and barbell weightlifting comes from responses in a Reddit thread on the r/fitness subreddit. People who tend to use the fitness subreddit are likely fitness enthusiasts - including beginners, intermediate, and advanced lifters. This community is diverse, with members ranging from casual gym-goers to serious athletes. As with most social media, typical ages of users on the fitness subreddit tend to be in the younger demographic, often ranging from late teens to early 30s. However, there are still users of all ages, including older individuals who are interested in maintaining their fitness and connecting with the community.\nThis module involves using the strength ratio to look at dot plots, construct and use confidence intervals, and discuss the effect that data collection methods have on the reliability of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this activity, you will:\n\nEnhance proficiency in constructing and interpreting confidence intervals.\nUnderstand the limitations of using smaller datasets of self-selected individuals.\nExplain the importance of obtaining a sample that reaches across multiple audiences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents are expected to have been exposed to one-sample inference for means (most likely t-intervals).

Additionally, the module worksheets can easily be adapted to be used with statistical software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dumbbell_barbell_weight_ratio data set contains observed strength ratios from 18 different weightlifters. Each row represents a different weightlifter.\nData is available on the SCORE Data Repository Website\nDownload data: dumbbell_barbell_weight_ratio.csv\n\n\nVariable Descriptions\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nRatio\nFlat dumbbell press to barbell bench press weight ratio\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeight Ratio\nThe data is sourced from a self-reported Reddit open forum.

    "text": "Please note that these material have not yet completed the required pedagogical and industry peer-reviews to become a published module on the SCORE Network. However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.\n\n\nThe FINA Junior World Diving Championships is a elite dive meet where top divers around the world under the age of 18 compete. Each diver completed 9 dives, all of which contributed to their overall score. Each dive is scored by 7 judges. Each judge gives a score individually on a scale of 1-10 at half-point increments based on execution of the dive. 10 represents perfect execution, while 0 represents failed execution. The two lowest and the two highest scores of the judges are voided, and the other three are added together. The sum of the three judges is then multiplied by the difficulty of the attempted dive. The product represent the points earned for that dive. The overall score is calculated by adding together the points earned on each dives.\nIn this worksheet, we will determine if there are statistical differences in mean total points scored between 16, 17, and 18-year old divers. Understanding how total score differs between different aged divers may tell us something about the importance of age, experince, and skill level in scoring points in diving.\nPreliminary video ideas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this activity, you will be able to:\n\nConduct and interpret a difference in means hypothesis test.\nConduct and interpret a difference in means ANOVA test.\nUnderstand how mean can differ between groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology requirement: The activity handout provides summary statistics so that no statistical software is required. However, the activity could be modified to ask students to conduct hypothesis tests through a statistical software, produce that information from the raw dataset, and/or extend the activity to investigate other variables available in the data.\n\nHypothesis Tests: Knowledge of hypothesis tests are vital to this activity.

However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.\n\n\nThe FINA Junior World Diving Championships is a elite dive meet where top divers around the world under the age of 18 compete. Each diver completed 9 dives, all of which contributed to their overall score. Each dive is scored by 7 judges. Each judge gives a score individually on a scale of 1-10 at half-point increments based on execution of the dive. 10 represents perfect execution, while 0 represents failed execution. The two lowest and the two highest scores of the judges are voided, and the other three are added together. The sum of the three judges is then multiplied by the difficulty of the attempted dive. The product represent the points earned for that dive. The overall score is calculated by adding together the points earned on each dives.\nIn this worksheet, we will determine if there are statistical differences in mean total points scored between 16, 17, and 18-year old divers. Understanding how total score differs between different aged divers may tell us something about the importance of age, experince, and skill level in scoring points in diving.\nPreliminary video ideas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this activity, you will be able to:\n\nConduct and interpret a difference in means hypothesis test.\nConduct and interpret a difference in means ANOVA test.\nUnderstand how mean can differ between groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology requirement: The activity handout provides summary statistics so that no statistical software is required.

Striking techniques include punches, kicks, knees, and elbows. The goal of striking is to damage or knock out the opponent. Martial arts disciplines that focus heavily on striking include boxing, Muay Thai, kickboxing, and karate.↩︎\nGrappling involves maneuvers and techniques used to control, throw, or submit an opponent without striking them. This includes techniques like clinching, takedowns, throws, joint locks, and chokeholds. The aim is to dominate the opponent through superior positioning and leverage, often leading to submissions. Grappling is a core component of martial arts such as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, wrestling, Judo, and Sambo.↩︎",

    "text": "Disc Golf is a rapidly growing sport with a full fledged professional circuit and tournaments all over the world. The Disc Golf Pro Tour (DGPT) allows top level players to compete week after week across the United States, Canada, and Europe. With top level tournaments offering over $100,000 of prize money at many tournaments, players need a vast skill set to compete at the highest level. Similarly to ball golf, the two main types of shots in disc golf are driving and putting. Driving happens from the teeing area and putting happens on the ‘green’ where players try to throw their disc into the basket.\nThe data set for this activity was taken from DGPT and Major tournament statistics found on the Professional Disc Golf Association’s official statistics website, StatMando. Each row contains a player who has played at least 40% of rounds during the DGPT season and has finished the tournament above the cash line at least once.

This is their tee shot on a par 3, 2nd shot on a par 4, and third shot on a par 5. C1 is defined by a 10m circle around the basket.\nCircle 2 in Regulation(C2R): This has the same definition as Circle 1 in Regulation, but Circle 2 extends to within 20m(66ft) of the basket.\nFairways Hit(FWY): This is the percent of holes where the player lands on the fairway with their drive. This includes being inside Circle 1 or 2 on a drive.\nScramble(SCR): A scramble is when a player scores par or better on a hole after missing the fairway or being out-of-bounds. Scramble percentage is the percentage of holes where a player scored par or better after an errant drive.\nCircle 1X putting(C1X): The putting percentage of the player from within Circle 1 (10m/66ft), excluding tap in putts within 10ft of the basket.\nCircle 2 putting(C2P): The putting percentage of the player from Circle 2 (10m-20m/33ft-66ft).\nStrokes Gained Tee to Green(SG:TG): This is the number of strokes by which the player has exceeded the average throwing performance of the field on drives and approaches.\nStrokes Gained Putting(SG:P): This is the number of strokes by which the player has exceeded the average putting performance of the field in circle 1 and 2.\n\n\n\nData Source\nThe data is obtained from the PDGA’s official statistics provider StatMando.\n\n\n\n\nDGPT24.csv - data set containing statistics from the 2024 DGPT season found on the SCORE Network Data Repository\nDGPT24_questions.docx - questions about correlation between total earnings and putting and driving\nDGPT24_questions_tech.docx - questions about correlation where students use the data to build their own solutions\nSolutions for questions:\nDGPT24_questions_ans.docx\nDGPT24_questions_tech_ans.docx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents should find that there is a stronger correlation between driving and performance statistics than putting and performance statistics.",

A score of eagle or better also counts as a shot being parked.\nCircle 1 in Regulation(C1R): When a player’s disc comes to rest within 10m(33ft) of the basket in the expected amount of shots. This is their tee shot on a par 3, 2nd shot on a par 4, and third shot on a par 5. C1 is defined by a 10m circle around the basket.\nCircle 2 in Regulation(C2R): This has the same definition as Circle 1 in Regulation, but Circle 2 extends to within 20m(66ft) of the basket.\nFairways Hit(FWY): This is the percent of holes where the player lands on the fairway with their drive. This includes being inside Circle 1 or 2 on a drive.\nScramble(SCR): A scramble is when a player scores par or better on a hole after missing the fairway or being out-of-bounds. Scramble percentage is the percentage of holes where a player scored par or better after an errant drive.\nCircle 1X putting(C1X): The putting percentage of the player from within Circle 1 (10m/66ft), excluding tap in putts within 10ft of the basket.\nCircle 2 putting(C2P): The putting percentage of the player from Circle 2 (10m-20m/33ft-66ft).\nStrokes Gained Tee to Green(SG:TG): This is the number of strokes by which the player has exceeded the average throwing performance of the field on drives and approaches.\nStrokes Gained Putting(SG:P): This is the number of strokes by which the player has exceeded the average putting performance of the field in circle 1 and 2.\n\n\n\nData Source\nThe data is obtained from the PDGA’s official statistics provider StatMando.\n\n\n\n\nDGPT24.csv - data set containing statistics from the 2024 DGPT season found on the SCORE Network Data Repository\nDGPT24_questions.docx - questions about correlation between total earnings and putting and driving\nDGPT24_questions_tech.docx - questions about correlation where students use the data to build their own solutions\nSolutions for questions:\nDGPT24_questions_ans.docx\nDGPT24_questions_tech_ans.docx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents should find that there is a stronger correlation between driving and performance statistics than putting and performance statistics.",

However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeague of Legends (LoL) is a 5 v. 5 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Riot Games. In this game, players assume the role of a “champion” with unique abilities and engage in intense battles against a team of other players or computer-controlled champions. Riot Games continually collects data to evaluate the impact of each champion, adjusting and fine-tuning various aspects to ensure fair and competitive gameplay. With regular updates (patches) occurring every two weeks, champions can become either extremely efficient and strong or in need of adjustments to enhance their abilities. Maintaining overall game balance is crucial, and developers employ strategies known as “nerfing” and “buffing” to achieve this balance. “Nerfing” refers to reducing the power or effectiveness of a champion or item, while “buffing” involves increasing its power or effectiveness.\nIn this worksheet, we will analyze and describe histograms of Win Rates for different champions in LoL. The Win Rate, a key metric in the game, represents the percentage of games won by a champion out of the total games played. Understanding the distribution of Win Rates and identifying potential outliers can provide valuable insights into champion balance and performance, informing strategic decision-making in LoL gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this activity, you will be able to:\n\nUnderstand the concept of histograms and their relevance in statistical analysis.\nAnalyze and describe histograms to gain insights into the distribution of Win Rates in League of Legends.

You should understand how to interpret histograms, including the concepts of bins, frequencies, and the shape, center, and spread of distributions.\nOutliers: Knowledge of outliers, which are data points that deviate significantly from the overall pattern, is important.\nFamiliarity with basic statistical analysis techniques, such as measures of central tendency (mean, median) and measures of dispersion (standard deviation, range), will aid in interpreting and analyzing the histograms.

However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.\n\n\nFormula 1 (F1) Racing is the highest class of single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA). Each year, an F1 season features a series of races, known as Grand Prix, which are held in a variety of countries and circuit types. Each of these circuits have their own characteristic’s that make the race unique, ranging from overall track layout and location, to specific corners and race-day weather conditions. Each season, teams and drivers compete for the World Constructors’ Championship and the World Drivers’ Championship, respectively. For the full history and more information about the sport, visit F1’s Wikipedia page here or their website here.\nAt the time of racing, the 2023 Miami Grand Prix was only the 11th time in F1’s history where all cars that started the race crossed the finish line. This meant that there were no crashes, mechanical failures, or race-ending driver mistakes. Shockingly, there were also no yellow or red flags issued to indicate an incident on or off the track ahead. In addition, there were no safety cars deployed that could slow or bring the field together.\nIn this worksheet, we will analyze and describe distributions of lap times for Max Verstappen for the 2023 F1 Miami Grand Prix. Lap times over the course of a race are determined by a multitude of factors, including tire softness (usually a change in tenths of a second) or pit stops (a change in time by upwards of 15 seconds). Understanding the distribution of lap times over the course of a race and identifying potential outliers can provide valuable insights into the consistency and performance of a driver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this activity, you will be able to:\n\nUnderstand the concept of histograms and their relevance in statistical analysis.\nIdentify potential outliers in a numerical variable using numerical methods such as the “1.5 IQR Rule”.\nUnderstand outliers and their effect on the data/summary statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology requirement: The activity handout provides histograms and summary statistics so that no statistical software is required.

Students should understand how to interpret histograms, using shape, center, and spread of distributions.\nOutliers: Knowledge of outliers is important.\nFamiliarity with basic statistical analysis techniques, such as measures of central tendency (mean, median) and measures of dispersion (standard deviation, range), will aid in interpreting and analyzing the histograms.\nKnowledge of outlier detection methods (such as the 1.5 IQR Rule) is needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data set contains 1138 rows and 7 columns. Each row represents a single lap by a driver who competed in the 2023 F1 Miami Grand Prix.

However, instructors are still welcome to use these materials if they are so inclined.\n\n\nThe Ski to Sea race is a multi-sport relay race held annually in Whatcom County, Washington. The race consists of seven legs: cross-country skiing, downhill skiing or snowboarding, running, road biking, canoeing, mountain biking, and kayaking, with each leg representing a different outdoor sport. A team will consist of one person for each leg of the race, except for the canoe leg which has two paddlers per canoe. Racers are allowed to compete in multiple legs of the race. A team must have a minimum of three racers and a maximum of eight, with a maximum of three legs per individual. The canoe leg must have two participants regardless of the number or racers per team. The Ski to Sea Race does not allow individuals to complete all legs of the race.\nThis module focuses on analyzing which leg of the race is most important to a team’s success for the Ski to Sea Race. Focusing on the correlation of time in minutes taken to complete each leg, this module examines the relative importance of each leg in contributing to the overall time in the Ski to Sea race.\nThe dataset for this activity was obtained from the Ski to Sea Website\nEach row of data provides the leg race times in minutes for a team in a given year. Each row is distinguished by a team name (Team Name) for a given year (Year). The time variables include (canoe_minutes), (xcski_minutes), (downhill_minutes), (kayak_minutes), (run_minutes), (xcbike_minutes), and (roadbike_minutes).

The race consists of seven legs: cross-country skiing, downhill skiing or snowboarding, running, road biking, canoeing, mountain biking, and kayaking, with each leg representing a different outdoor sport. A team will consist of one person for each leg of the race, except for the canoe leg which has two paddlers per canoe. Racers are allowed to compete in multiple legs of the race. A team must have a minimum of three racers and a maximum of eight, with a maximum of three legs per individual. The canoe leg must have two participants regardless of the number or racers per team. The Ski to Sea Race does not allow individuals to complete all legs of the race.\nThis module focuses on analyzing which leg of the race is most important to a team’s success for the Ski to Sea Race. Focusing on the correlation of time in minutes taken to complete each leg, this module examines the relative importance of each leg in contributing to the overall time in the Ski to Sea race.\nThe dataset for this activity was obtained from the Ski to Sea Website\nEach row of data provides the leg race times in minutes for a team in a given year.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome video\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nFor this activity, you will be exploring the result times from female and male runners that finished the 2023 Boston Marathon.\nIn particular, you will examine both visualizations and summary statistics of result times to explore the variation in finish times as well as use comparative techniques, such as z-scores, to compare and contrast male and female participants.\nInvestigating these trends is useful for several reasons. Firstly, exploring these trends can help to deepen our understanding of how different factors, such as gender, impact marathon performances. Secondly, analyzing the distribution of finish times and the performance of top finishers against the masses provides insights into the competitive landscape of the marathon. It can identify outliers or exceptional performances and understand how elite athletes compare to average participants. Although not directly connected to this data, analyses like these can inform training strategies, highlight the effectiveness of different preparation methods, and inspire both new and experienced runners by showcasing the range of achievable performances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity Length\n\n\n\n\n\nThis activity would be suitable for an in-class example or quiz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of the activity, you will be able to:\n\nAnalyze distributions using histograms\nIdentify potential confounding variables to explain bimodal data\nCompare and contrast distributions for a pair of groups\nCalculate and compare z-scores for individual cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this activity, students will primarily use basic concepts of histograms and summary statistics to analyze distributions. Students will also likely require knowledge of z-scores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology Requiremens\n\n\n\n\n\nThe provided worksheets do not require any specific statistical software. (Although they will likely require access to a calculator.)\nSince the data are provided, instructors are encouraged to modify the worksheets to have student construct visualizations and calculate summary statistics using whichever software they choose.\n\n\n\n\n\nData\nThe data set contains 26598 rows and 15 columns. Each row represents a runner who completed the Boston Marathon in 2023\nDownload data:\nAvailable on the SCORE Data Repository: boston_marathon_2023.csv\n\n\nVariable Descriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nage_group\nage group of the runner\n\n\nplace_overall\nfinishing place of the runner out of all runners\n\n\nplace_gender\nfinishing place of runner among the same gender\n\n\nplace_division\nfinishing place of runner among runners of the same gender and age group\n\n\nname\nname of runner\n\n\ngender\ngender of runner\n\n\nteam\nteam the runner is affiliated with\n\n\nbib_number\nbib number of runner\n\n\nhalf_time\nhalf marathon time of runner\n\n\nfinish_net\nfinishing time timed from when they cross the starting gate\n\n\nfinish_gun\nfinishing time of runner timed from when the starter gun is fired\n\n\nhalf_time_sec\nhalf marathon time in seconds\n\n\nfinish_net_sec\nnet finish in seconds\n\n\nfinish_gun_sec\ngun finish in seconds\n\n\nfinish_net_minutes\nnet finish in minutes\n\n\n\nData Source\nBoston Athletic Association\n\n\n\nMaterials\nWe provide editable MS Word handouts along with their solutions.\nClass handout\nClass handout - with solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the Boston Marathon Times worksheet provides valuable learning opportunities for students in several key areas. It allows them to understand reasons by variability might exist and to discover multimodal distributions can occur simply due to excluding an important explanatory variable that otherwise confounds the analysis. The calculation of z-scores or other similar measurement of relative location enables students to compare and contrast the remarkable achievements of the top female and male finishers, shedding light on their talent in their respective fields. Overall, this worksheet allows students to critically analyze the 2023 marathon result data and draw meaningful conclusions about the extraordinary performances of athletes in the race.",

Additionally, the 95% confidence interval for the slope term of Swim Time excluded 0, further affirming its significance.\nHowever, when both Swim Times and Bike Times were included as predictors in the multiple linear regression model, we observed a change in significance. Swim Times were no longer a significant predictor. This finding suggests that when considering both predictors simultaneously, the predictive power of Swim Times in estimating run times diminishes.
