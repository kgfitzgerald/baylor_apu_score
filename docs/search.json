By hitting the ball into your opponents side of the court without them successfully returning the ball. (Or by them committing an unforced error such as a missed serve or running into the net, but we won’t worry about that in this analysis).\nPlay begins on each point with a serve from the back line and ends when the ball hits the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolleyball “stats” that might occur during any given play\n\n\n\n\nAn ace is a serve that directly results in a point (the opponent does not successfully return the serve).\nAn attack is on offensive play where a player strategically hits the ball over the net using an overhead motion\nA kill is when an attack results in a point for the attacking team (the opposing team doesn’t “dig” or successfully return the ball)\nAn assist is recorded when a player passes or sets the ball to a teammate who attacks the ball for a kill.\nA block is a defensive play at the net when a player successfully blocks the ball from an opponent’s attack, sending it back down into the opponent’s court, directly resulting in a point.\nA dig is a defensive play when a player successfully passes the ball from an attack and keeps it in play",

    "section": "Why does sample size matter",
    "text": "Why does sample size matter\nThere are several things that drive the need for sample size calculations. One is resources. Often it is costly - financially, time, difficulty in getting data - to conduct an experiment so we wish to do so efficiently, with the smallest sample possible. The second is that we want a sample size that will ensure we can get meaningful results from our study. The last thing anyone wants after spending time and money on research is for the results to be inconclusive.\n\nTypes of errors\nTwo types of errors can occur with a statistical hypotheses test.\n\nType I error: the null hypothesis is true but we reject it.\nType II error: the null hypothesis is false but we fail to reject it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe errors are a trade off - if we improve one, the other is worse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\n\nFor our proposed study of a method to improve first serve perentage:\n\nWhat would it mean to have a Type I error?\nWhat would it mean to have a Type II error?\nIs one error “worse” than the other in this case? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\nBalancing the errors\nOur goal is to maintain reasonably small chances of both types of errors. The Type I error is typically handled by specifying the probability we make such an error in our hypothesis testing procedure. This probability is usually referred to as \\(\\alpha\\) (“alpha”) and set to a low value. Most typically we use \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). The Type II error, on the other hand, is NOT specified in the testing. This is where sample size can play a role.\nReturning to our example, suppose we collect a sample and the first serve percentage without the training is 50% and after the training it is 75%. Using an \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) value, however, we do not reject the null hypothesis. We cannot conclude the sample provides evidence of improvement…even though it seems like a rather positive effect!\nOur sample was from two games with 4 first serves each…a very small sample. The problem is that with such a small sample we lack power to detect a difference even if it exists. Power is defined as:\n\\[Power = 1 - \\beta\\] Where \\(\\beta\\) is the Type II error rate. Thus, we controlled Type I error but our Type II error rate may be too high!\nSmall samples lead to large uncertainty about the estimates. Consider the 50% estimate for without training. That was based on 2 of 4 successful serves. However, if only one of the serves had been different (say one more success) that percentage would change by 25%!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nA study that has too small of a sample size to detect a meaningful effect is said to be under powered. The Type II error rate is very high.\n\n\nWe thus want a sample large enough that it will reject the null hypothesis when there is a true effect. Generally speaking, resource constraints lead to trying to find the smallest sample size that has adequate power to do so. There is little danger of getting “too large” a sample. You might wonder, though, if resources permit why not just get a super large sample. That would give very high power!\nThe problem with a very large sample is that there is power to detect very, very small effects. For example, suppose we get a sample of millions of serves. The result is 50% success without the training and 50.1% with the training. The gigantic sample could lead to rejecting the null hypothesis, thus concluding there is evidence of difference due to the training.\nThe sample size gives us great precision in these estimates…and, after, all technically they are different. However, clearly the effect is not really a difference that any tennis play would care about enough to hire you as their trainer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nA study that has too large of a sample size to detect a meaningful effect is said to be over powered. The Type II error rate is so low that meaningless effects are said to be significant.",

We will compute sample size for a desired power, and set the first two parameters to typical values:\n\nPower = \\(0.8\\)\n\\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)\n\nThe variability is often estimated from pilot or previous data, or using information from previous studies. We will use our Wimbledon 2023 data. We can compute the standard deviations (sd) for player one run distances and also for player two run distances:\n\nsd(tennis$p1_distance_run)\n\n[1] 13.49286\n\nsd(tennis$p2_distance_run)\n\n[1] 13.60765\n\n\nBoth are similar and around 13.5 meters/point. So, we will choose this value:\n\nsd = 13.5 meters/point (estimated variability)\n\nThe final value we need is the value of the difference in run distance that we would consider meaningful. The mean values for the run distances in the Wimbledon data are:\n\nmean(tennis$p1_distance_run)\n\n[1] 14.00231\n\nmean(tennis$p2_distance_run)\n\n[1] 13.86924\n\n\nBoth are around 14 meters/point. What would represent a meaningful increase for the distance run on clay?\nOne tool that could help is to consider effect size. Cohen (1988) offers some advice. A metric known as Cohen’s D is one measure and is defined:\n\\[D = \\frac{\\mu_2 - \\mu_1}{sd}\\] where the sd is of the difference in means. If the average distance on clay increases by one standard deviation, then \\(D = 1\\). In other words, Cohen’s D is the increase in terms of the standard deviation. If \\(D = 0.5\\) that would be an increase of half of a standard deviation,\nAn increase of 1 standard deviation (13.5 meters/point) seems large as it would nearly double the average run per point.\nThe R package “effectsize” contains a function to provide an interpretation of Cohen’s D values. We provide interpretation for the one standard deviation increase (13.5 meters/point) and for smaller increases of 0.5 and 0.25 standard deviations.\n\ninterpret_cohens_d(1)\n\n[1] \"large\"\n(Rules: cohen1988)\n\ninterpret_cohens_d(0.5)\n\n[1] \"medium\"\n(Rules: cohen1988)\n\ninterpret_cohens_d(0.25)\n\n[1] \"small\"\n(Rules: cohen1988)\n\n\nWe will opt for a “medium” effect size using the \\(D = 0.5\\) value.

    "text": "Estimating the Parameters\nWe will again compute sample size for a desired power, and set the first two parameters to typical values:\n\nPower = \\(0.8\\)\n\\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)\n\nThe third parameter, estimate of variability, is not needed for the two sample proportions test. The reason is that the variance for a proportion is actually a function of the proportion. This comes from the variance for a binary (0 or 1) variable which is modeled using the Binomial (Bernoulli) distribution. If the true proportion is p, then the variance is:\n\\[p \\times (1-p)\\]\nSo, once we provide a hypothesized value for p, then the variance can be computed!\nThe fourth parameter is again the difference we would consider meaningful. We can use our data to get an estimate for the proportion of points won on grass for a first serve.\nWe first get the percentage for player one. The “filter” function allows us to select only first serve data (“serve_no ==1”) when player one is serving (“server == 1”). We then obtain the table with percentages of which player won the point.\n\np1serve1 &lt;- tennis |&gt; filter(serve_no == 1 & server == 1)\nPercTable(p1serve1$point_victor)\n\n               \n    freq   perc\n               \n1  1'728  76.6%\n2    529  23.4%\n\n\nSince player 1 is the server in this reduced data set, we see that the server wins 76.6% of the points.\nWe can repeat this for player two (below) and find a similar percentage of 74.3%.\n\np2serve1 &lt;- tennis |&gt; filter(serve_no == 1 & server == 2)\nPercTable(p2serve1$point_victor)\n\n               \n    freq   perc\n               \n1    616  25.7%\n2  1'784  74.3%\n\n\nWe select a reasonable percentage then for Wimbledon (grass) of 75%. The question is what would be a noteworthy difference in winning percentage on clay.\nWe can again consider effect size, and R package “pwr” provides a function “ES.h” that computes an effect size based on two proportions known as Cohen’s H (Cohen, 1988). The rules of thumb for this value are the same as for Cohen’s D, so we can again use the “interpret_cohens_d” function once we obtain a value.\nLet’s see what the effect size is if the percentage won on clay is only 50%:\n\nprop_effect &lt;- ES.h(0.75, 0.5)\nprop_effect\n\n[1] 0.5235988\n\ninterpret_cohens_d(prop_effect)\n\n[1] \"medium\"\n(Rules: cohen1988)\n\n\nThe result is a “medium” effect, but practically that seems like an unlikely change. Even though clay might reduce the serve advantage, it still probably exists. Let’s consider reducing the advantage to 65%:\n\nprop_effect &lt;- ES.h(0.75, 0.65)\nprop_effect\n\n[1] 0.2189061\n\ninterpret_cohens_d(prop_effect)\n\n[1] \"small\"\n(Rules: cohen1988)\n\n\nThis is a small effect size, but practically certainly meaningful so we will use this in our calculations:\n\nDifference in proportions: 0.1 (from 0.75 to 0.65)",

    "section": "Testing Hypothesized Proportions",
    "text": "Testing Hypothesized Proportions\n\nSetting Up Hypotheses\nIn hypothesis testing for proportions, a null hypothesis is set up to test a claim about a population proportion. The null hypothesis is that the population proportion is equal to a specific value. The alternative hypothesis can be that the population proportion is not equal to the specific value, greater than the specific value, or less than the specific value.\nThe options are shown below:\n\n\nNOTE: It is common practice to denote a null hypothesis with \\(H_0\\) and an alternative hypothesis with \\(H_A\\). Sometime the alternative hypothesis is denoted with \\(H_1\\).\n\\(H_0: p = p_0\\)\nand\n\\(H_A: p \\neq p_0\\) or\n\\(H_A: p &gt; p_0\\) or\n\\(H_A: p &lt; p_0\\)\nWhere \\(p_0\\) is the hypothesized value of the population proportion and \\(p\\) is the true population proportion.\n\n\nSignificance Level\nFor hypothesis testing, a significance level is set to determine the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. The significance level is denoted by \\(\\alpha\\) and is often set to 0.05. This means that there is a 5% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. Other common significance levels are 0.01 and 0.10.\n\n\nCalculating the Test Statistic\nA test statistic is a value calculated from the sample data that is used to determine whether the null hypothesis should be rejected or not.\nThe test statistic for hypothesis testing for proportions is:\n\\[z = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p_0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p_0(1 - p_0)}{n}}}\\]\nWhere \\(\\hat{p}\\) is the sample proportion, \\(p_0\\) is the hypothesized value of the population proportion, and \\(n\\) is the sample size.\n\n\nDetermining the Significance of the Test\nThere are two common ways to determine the significance of the test:\n\nCompare the test statistic to the critical value\nCompare the p-value to the significance level\n\nThe first method compares the test statistic to the critical value. The critical value is the value that separates the rejection region from the non-rejection region. If the test statistic is in the rejection region, the null hypothesis is rejected. This also corresponds to the confidence intervals given for true probability of success. If the hypothesized value of the population proportion is within the confidence interval, the null hypothesis is not rejected. If it is outside the confidence interval, the null hypothesis is rejected.\nThe p-value is the most common way to determine the significance of the test. The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as the one calculated from the sample data, assuming the null hypothesis is true. If the p-value is less than the significance level, the null hypothesis is rejected.\n\n\nHypothesis Testing in R\nHypothesis testing for proportions can also be done in R using the binom.test() function. Seen below is an example where it is being tested if the true proportion of successes is different than .7. The first test shows the results if the sample proportion had 60 out of 100 successes and the second test shows the results if the sample proportion had 70 out of 100 successes. Both tests are done using an \\(\\alpha\\) level of 0.05.\n\nbinom.test(60, 100, p = .7, conf.level = .95)\n\n\n    Exact binomial test\n\ndata:  60 and 100\nnumber of successes = 60, number of trials = 100, p-value = 0.03745\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.7\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.4972092 0.6967052\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n                   0.6 \n\nbinom.test(70, 100, p = .7, conf.level = .95)\n\n\n    Exact binomial test\n\ndata:  70 and 100\nnumber of successes = 70, number of trials = 100, p-value = 1\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.7\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.6001853 0.7875936\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n                   0.7 \n\n\nThe p-value of the test is returned in the output of the binom.test() function. For the first test, the p-value is 0.037 and for the second test, the p-value is 1. Since the p-value of the first test is less than the significance level of 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected. Since the p-value of the second test is greater than the significance level of 0.05, the null hypothesis is not rejected.\n\n\nDrawing Conclusions\nIf the null hypothesis is rejected we can conclude that the sample data provides enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis. If the Null Hypothesis was that the population proportion is equal to .7 and the alternative hypothesis was that the population proportion is not equal to .7 and \\(\\alpha = 0.5\\), then we might say,\n“There is significant evidence to suggest that the true population proportion is not equal to .7 at the 95% confidence level.”\nIf the null hypothesis is not rejected we do not automatically accept the null hypothesis. We simply do not have enough evidence to reject it. For example if the null hypothesis was that the population proportion is equal to .7 and the alternative hypothesis was that the population proportion is not equal to .7 and \\(\\alpha = .05\\), then we might say,\nThere is not enough evidence to suggest that the true population proportion is different from .7 at the 95% confidence level.”\n\n\nExample\nSuppose you are watching a golf tournament on TV and Scottie Scheffler is about to hit an approach shot from the fairway. You hear the announcer say that Scottie Scheffler hits 3/4 of his greens in regulation from the fairway. You are skeptical of this claim and decide to test it against the data you have collected at the 95% confidence level.\nYou set up a hypothesis test with the following hypotheses:\n\nNull Hypothesis \\(H_0\\): The proportion of greens hit in regulation by Scottie Scheffler from the fairway is 0.75.\nAlternative Hypothesis \\(H_A\\): The proportion of greens hit in regulation by Scottie Scheffler from the fairway is not 0.75.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Confidence Intervals for Hypothesis Testing\n\n\n\nUse the binom.test() function to test the hypothesis that the proportion of greens hit in regulation by Scottie Scheffler from the fairway is 0.75. \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\).\n\nWhat is the p-value of the test?\nBased on the p-value, do you reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis?\nWhat is your conclusion?",

There are Par 3 holes, Par 4 holes, and Par 5 holes.\nThere are 18 holes on a golf course and the pars of each of these holes sums to par for the course, also known the course par.\n\nA round in golf is when a golfer plays the full set of 18 holes on the course.\n\nIn most professional golf tournaments, all golfers play 2 rounds, the best golfers are selected and those golfers play 2 more rounds for a total of 4 rounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Golf Tours\n\n\n\n\nIn golf there are a few tours, better thought of as leagues, that golfers regularly compete in\n\nThe PGA, or “Professional Golf Association”, has long been considered the preeminant golfing tour, hosting most tournaments and containing the most skilled members.\nThe LIV Tour is a Saudi-backed alternative to the PGA that was formed in 2022. LIV is the Roman numeral for 54 and is related to the fact that LIV tournaments only allow 54 players and only play 54 holes, compared to the normal PGA 72 holes.\nThe PGA Tour Champions Tour is a branch off of the PGA tour for players 50 or older. It used to be called the “Senior PGA Tour” until 2003, when it began being called the Champions tour\nAn amateur is a golfer who is not yet a professional. They are not allowed to win money in professional golf tournaments. Most amateurs are college golfers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPGA vs. LIV\n\nvs\n\nImages Source: PGA and LIV\nClick here to read about LIV golf’s founding and its continued impact on the PGA tour.",

    "text": "z-interval for single means\nA standard normal distribution (also known as a z-distribution) is used to calculate the confidence interval for a single mean if the sample size is large enough (greater than 30) or the population standard deviation is known. The first case is common as oftentimes samples are greater than 30. The second case is rare because it is uncommon to know the population standard deviation but not the population mean.\nThe formula for the confidence interval for a single mean using the z-distribution is very similar to that of the t-distribution\n\n\nClick here for more information about the standard normal distribution.\n\\(CI = \\bar{X} \\pm Z_{\\alpha/2} \\times \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\)\nWhere \\(\\bar{X}\\) is once again the sample mean, \\(Z_{\\alpha/2}\\) is the critical value for the standard normal distribution at the specified confidence level, \\({\\sigma}\\) is the population standard deviation, and \\(n\\) is the sample size.\nThe reasoning behind why we can use the standard normal distribution when the sample is greater than 30 even if the population standard deviation is unknown is found in the Central Limit Theorem, which says that as the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution. This means that when the sample size is greater than 30 we can use the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation and create a confidence interval as seen below\n\\(CI = \\bar{X} \\pm Z_{\\alpha/2} \\times \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}}\\)\nOnce again the critical value for the z-distribution is the value of \\(Z_{\\alpha/2}\\) such that the area under the standard normal distribution curve between \\(-Z_{\\alpha/2}\\) and \\(Z_{\\alpha/2}\\) is equal to the confidence level.\nR can compute the z-value for you using the qnorm() function. The qnorm() function takes in the probability and returns the z-value that corresponds to that probability. For example, qnorm(.975) will return the z-value that corresponds to the 97.5th percentile of the standard normal distribution. No degrees of freedom are needed.\nThe code below calculates the critical values for the z-distribution for a 95% confidence interval.\n(Note that .975 is used for a 95% confidence interval because \\(\\alpha = .05\\) and since the confidence interval is two sided we need half of the error each side so \\(\\alpha / 2  = .025\\), which means we want to use qnorm(.975) or qnorm(.025))\n\nqnorm(.975)\n\n[1] 1.959964\n\nqnorm(.025)\n\n[1] -1.959964\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: z-distribution confidence intervals\n\n\n\nRun the code below to create the proper subset of the data for this exercise and calculate the sample mean, sample standard deviation, and critical value for the z-distribution.\n\npga_round1 &lt;- masters_2023 |&gt; \n  filter(round == 1, tour == \"PGA\")\nx_bar &lt;- pga_round1 |&gt; \n  summarise(mean(score)) |&gt; \n  pull()\nsigma &lt;- pga_round1 |&gt; \n  summarise(sd(score)) |&gt; \n  pull()\nz_cv &lt;- qnorm(.975)\n\nUse the formula for creating a confidence interval using the standard normal distribution to calculate the upper and lower limits of a confidence interval for the true mean of PGA professional scoring at Augusta using the PGA pros in the first round as our sample.

    "section": "To Reject or Fail to Reject",
    "text": "To Reject or Fail to Reject\nThere are two ways to make a decision about the null hypothesis.\nMethod 1: Critical values, along with test statistics, can be used to determine if the hypothesized population mean is within the confidence interval for the true mean.\nA critical value is a value that separates the rejection region from the non-rejection region. The rejection region is the area where the null hypothesis is rejected. The non-rejection region is the area where the null hypothesis is not rejected. The critical value is determined by the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) and the degrees of freedom (if it is a t-test). The critical value is compared to the test statistic to determine if the null hypothesis should be rejected. If the test statistic is within the non-rejection region, the null hypothesis is not rejected. If the test statistic is within the rejection region, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted.\nBelow is an example of using critical values and a test-statistic for a z-test with a 95% confidence level (two-sided). The critical value is 1.96. This means that if the test statistic is greater than 1.96 or less than -1.96, the null hypothesis is rejected. The blue represents the non-rejection region and the red the rejection region. Since the Test Statistic for this hypothetical example is 1.1 (less than 1.96 and greater than -1.96), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis method corresponds directly to the related confidence intervals produced for the sample data.\nIf the hypothesized population mean is within the confidence interval, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. If the hypothesized population mean is not within the confidence interval, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted.\n\n\nNote: We can say that there is significant evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis if the null hypothesis is rejected. However, it should never be said that we accept the null hypothesis. We can only fail to reject it.\nMethod 2: The second method is to use a p-value. The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as the one calculated from the sample data given that the null hypothesis is true. The p-value is compared to the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) to determine if the null hypothesis should be rejected. If the p-value is less than \\(\\alpha\\), the null hypothesis is rejected. If the p-value is greater than \\(\\alpha\\), the null hypothesis is not rejected.\nFor example, if the p-value for a single mean hypothesis test is 0.03 and the significance level is 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected because the p-value is less than the significance level.",

We would like to test if the mean of PGA professional scoring is not equal to 72 at Augusta National.\n\nWhat is the null hypothesis for this test?\nWhat is the alternative hypothesis for this test?\n\n\n\nUse the z.test function to test if the mean of PGA professional scoring is not equal to 72 using the pga_round1 sample from earlier in the lesson. What is the p-value?\nBased on the confidence interval, is there statistically significant evidence that the mean of PGA professional scoring is not equal to 72?\nExplain your answer to part d.\n\n\n\n\nTIP Use the $score column from the pga_round1 sample as the first argument in the z.test function\nTIP Remember that the z.test function requires the population standard deviation as the second argument. Use the sd function to calculate the standard deviation of the pga_round1 sample.\n\nsd(pga_round1$score)",
