Their final deliverable is to turn in an .html document produced by “Rendering” the .qmd.\nPosit Cloud (via an Instructor account) or Github classroom are good options for disseminating files to students, but simply uploading files to your university’s course management system works, too.",

    "text": "Volleyball lingo\nBefore proceeding with any analysis, let’s make sure we know some volleyball lingo in order to understand what information is contained in each variable (column) in our dataset.\n\n\nTotally new to volleyball? Watch this 4-minute video: The Rules of Volleyball - EXPLAINED!\n\nBe the first team to win 3 sets to 25 points!!\n Image source: BoxOut Sports\n\n\nThe basics\n\nTo win a volleyball match, your team must be the first to win 3 sets\nA match can consist of 3, 4, or 5 sets (“best 3 out of 5”)\nYour team wins a set if you are the first to score 25 points\n\nbut you have to win by at least 2 points!\nand the 5th match (if necessary) only goes to 15 points\n\nSo how do you score points? By hitting the ball into your opponents side of the court without them successfully returning the ball. (Or by them committing an unforced error such as a missed serve or running into the net, but we won’t worry about that in this analysis).\nPlay begins on each point with a serve from the back line and ends when the ball hits the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolleyball “stats” that might occur during any given play\n\n\n\n\nAn ace is a serve that directly results in a point (the opponent does not successfully return the serve).\nAn attack is on offensive play where a player strategically hits the ball over the net using an overhead motion\nA kill is when an attack results in a point for the attacking team (the opposing team doesn’t “dig” or successfully return the ball)\nAn assist is recorded when a player passes or sets the ball to a teammate who attacks the ball for a kill.\nA block is a defensive play at the net when a player successfully blocks the ball from an opponent’s attack, sending it back down into the opponent’s court, directly resulting in a point.\nA dig is a defensive play when a player successfully passes the ball from an attack and keeps it in play",

    "text": "Variable descriptions\nThe volleyball data you’ll be analyzing in this lab provides season-level team statistics for 334 teams during the 2022-3 season. Many of the variables are reported as an average “per set.” For example, if a team played 30 matches, this means they played anywhere from 90 to 150 sets during the season, so aces_per_set provides the number of aces they scored, on average, across those 90+ sets.

There are two ways to do this:\n\n\n\nTIP: Recall that RStudio is split into four quadrants: Source (upper left), Environment (upper right), Console (bottom left), and Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (bottom right)\n[INSERT ANNOTATED IMAGE HERE??]\n\ntype View(volleyball) in your Console and then click return/Enter on your keyboard.\nOR, in your Environment tab, double click the name of the dataset you want to view.\n\nThis will open up your data in a new viewer tab so that you can view it like a spreadsheet (like Google Sheets or Excel*). Once open, you can sort the data by clicking on a column.\n\n\n*Unlike Google Sheets or Excel, however, you won’t be able to edit the data directly in the spreadsheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\n\nView the volleyball data and sort it appropriately to answer the following questions:\n\nWhich NCAA Division I women’s volleyball team had the best record (highest win percentage) during the 2022-3 season?\nWhat percentage of their matches did this team win?\nWhat conference and region is this team in?\nWhich team had the worst record?\nWhat percentage of their matches did they win?\nWhat conference and region is this team in?\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP: When viewing the data, clicking on a column once will sort the data according to that variable in ascending order; clicking twice will sort in descending order.",
