This repository contains files for a SCORE module for teaching the Chi-square (and Fisher exact) test using MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) data. The module is designed for use in an introductory statistics course or independent learning and uses R to teach the topics.

This module is best viewed in HTML format. A preprint version of this module can be viewed at https://kgfitzgerald.github.io/baylor_apu_score/mma/mma_chisquare/. The module can also be viewed locally from files in the GitHub https://github.com/kgfitzgerald/baylor_apu_score/tree/main/mma by opening the R Project mma_chisquare.RProj, then opening the R Quarto file index.qmd, and then clicking "Render". 

The following files are included in this repository:

- `mma_chisquare.RProj`: R Project file for the module

- `index.qmd`: R Quarto file for the module

- `student_template.qmd`: R Quarto file for that can be downloaded to answer questions from the module with code and text. This could be turned in to an instructor if used in a course. 

- `mma.csv`: Data file used for most of the module containing information about results for MMA fights. The data is derived largely from 

- `mma_2024_chisq_glossary.csv`: Data glossary for the `mma.csv` data file.
