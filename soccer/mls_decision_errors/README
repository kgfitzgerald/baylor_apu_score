This repository contains files for a SCORE module for teaching about decision errors using data for about MLS training facilities and their points per match played. This module is designed for an introductory statistics course and does not require knowledge or usage of any programming language.

This module is best viewed in HTML format. A preprint version of this module can be viewed at https://kgfitzgerald.github.io/baylor_apu_score/soccer/mls_decision_errors/. The module can also be viewed locally by opening the R Project mls_decision_errors.RProj, then opening the R Quarto file index.qmd, and then clicking "Render". 

The files in this repository are as follows:

- `mls_decision_errors.RProj`: R Project file for the module

The information on the training facilities was obtained from https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/facts-figures-and-images-every-mls-training-facility and individual research on newer facilities. The information on points per match played was obtained from https://fbref.com/en/comps/22/2023/2023-Major-League-Soccer-Stats#all_league_summary. This data was combined into one file for the module.
