This repository contains files for a SCORE module for teaching the Kaplan-Meier estimator and basic survival analysis using American Ninja Warrior data. The module is designed for use in an intermediate statistics course or independent learning and uses R to teach the topics.

This module is best viewed in HTML format. A preprint version of this module can be viewed at https://kgfitzgerald.github.io/baylor_apu_score/anw/kaplan_meier/. The module can also be viewed locally by opening the R Project kaplan_meyer.RProj, then opening the R Quarto file index.qmd, and then clicking "Render". 

The following files are included in this repository:

- `kaplan_meyer.RProj`: R Project file for the module

- `index.qmd`: R Quarto file for the module

- `student_template.qmd`: R Quarto file for that can be downloaded to answer questions from the module with code and text. This could be turned in to an instructor if used in a course.
