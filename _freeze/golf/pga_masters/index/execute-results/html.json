The Masters is considered to be one of the greatest and most selective tournaments in the world of golf. Only the best current players or previous winners are allowed in. The winner of the Masters gets to wear the famed \"Green Jacket\" and return to play any year they would like at the Masters. The course The Masters is played at, Augusta National, is one of the most beautiful and challenging courses in the world. The course is known for its fast greens and tight fairways. The Masters is the first major of the year and is played in early April. The tournament is played over four days. After 2 days, the top 50 players and ties make the cut and play the final two days. \n\n::: column-margin\nScottie Scheffler after winning the 2023 Masters Tournament.\n\n![](masters_leaderboard.jpg)\nImage Source: [The PGA](https://www.pga.com/story/masters-green-jacket-history-and-facts)\n\n:::\n\n::: column-margin\n\nView the course at Augusta National [here](https://www.masters.com/en_US/course/index.html)\n\n:::\n\n\nAs mentioned before, only the best players and previous winners can compete in the tournament, With that being said, the Masters is one of the few tournaments that players from the newly created LIV golf tour can play in, although they are mostly qualifying because of their past performances at the Masters before they joined LIV golf. This leads to a mixture of regular PGA professionals, LIV professionals, Amateurs, and Seniors playing in the Masters in 2023. \n\n\nThe focus for this module is confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for the scores for different groups of players at the 2023 Masters. \n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Learning Objectives\" appearance=\"minimal\"}\nBy the end of this module, you will be able to:\n\n-   Read (import) a dataset into your RStudio Environment\n\n-   Make single mean confidence intervals\n\n-   Perform a hypothesis test for a single mean\n:::\n\n::: column-margin\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n**NOTE**: **R** is the name of the programming language itself and **RStudio** is a convenient interface.

There are **Par 3** holes, **Par 4** holes, and **Par 5** holes. \n    - There are 18 holes on a golf course and the **pars** of each of these holes sums to **par for the course**, also known the **course par**. \n-   A **round** in golf is when a golfer plays the full set of 18 holes on the course.\n    - In most professional golf tournaments, all golfers play **2 rounds**, the best golfers are selected and those golfers play 2 more rounds for a total of **4 rounds**.\n\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\n#### Types of Golf Tours\n- In golf there are a few **tours**, better thought of as leagues, that golfers regularly compete in\n\n     -  The **PGA**, or \"Professional Golf Association\", has long been considered the preeminant golfing tour, hosting most tournaments and containing the most skilled members.\n     - The **LIV** Tour is a Saudi-backed alternative to the PGA that was formed in 2022. **LIV** is the Roman numeral for 54 and is related to the fact that **LIV** tournaments only allow 54 players and only play 54 holes, compared to the normal PGA 72 holes.\n     - The **PGA Tour Champions** Tour is a branch off of the PGA tour for players 50 or older. It used to be called the \"Senior PGA Tour\" until 2003, when it began being called the **Champions** tour\n     - An **amateur** is a golfer who is not yet a professional. They are not allowed to win money in professional golf tournaments. Most **amateurs** are college golfers. \n\n:::\n\n::: column-margin\n\nPGA vs. LIV\n\n![](pga-logo.png)\n\nvs\n\n![](liv_logo.png)\n\nImages Source: [PGA](https://www.pgatour.com/) and [LIV](https://www.livgolf.com/)\n\nClick [here](https://www.si.com/golf/news/timeline-liv-golf-how-pga-tour-adapted) to read about LIV golf's founding and its continued impact on the PGA tour.\n\n:::\n\n## Variable descriptions\n\nThe `masters_2023` data you'll be analyzing in this lab provides scores for each round by each golfer in the 2023 Masters.

This is calculated by finding the value of $t_{\\alpha/2, df}$ such that the area under the t-distribution curve (with that specific degrees of freedom) between $-t_{\\alpha/2, df}$ and $t_{\\alpha/2, df}$ is equal to the confidence level. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: column-margin\n\n**NOTE**: Using R to calculate the critical value for the t-distribution saves time and adds accuracy compared to using a t-table.\n\n:::\n\n**R** can easily calculate the critical value for the t-distribution using the `qt()` function. \n\nThe `qt()` function takes two arguments: the first is the confidence level, and the second is the degrees of freedom. The example below shows how to calculate the t-value for a 95% confidence level with 10 degrees of freedom.\n\nNote that the 95% confidence interval has $\\alpha = .05$ and $\\alpha / 2 =  .025$ so we need to use `qt(.975, df= 10)` or `qt(.025, df = 10)` to find the critical values.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqt(0.975, df = 10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2.228139\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Exercise 2: t-distribution confidence intervals\"}\n\n:::column-margin\n**TIP**: Values and objects can be stored in variables in R. For example, `x <- 5` stores the value 5 in the variable `x`.\n\n**TIP**: The **pipe operator** is a powerful tool in R that allows you to chain functions together. It is denoted by `|>` and is used to pass the output of one function to the input of another function.\n\n**TIP**: The `pull()` function is used to extract a single column from a data frame as a vector.\n\n**TIP**: The `nrow()` function is used to calculate the number of rows in a data frame.\n:::\n\nRun the code below to create the proper subset of the data for this exercise and calculate the sample mean and sample standard deviation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\namateurs_round1 <- masters_2023 |> \n  filter(round == 1, tour == \"Amateur\")\nx_bar <- amateurs_round1 |> \n  summarise(mean(score)) |> \n  pull()\nstd_dev <- amateurs_round1 |> \n  summarize(sd(score)) |> \n  pull()\nn <- nrow(amateurs_round1)\nt_cv <- qt(0.95, df = n - 1)\n```\n:::\n\n\nUse the formula for creating a **confidence interval** using the t-distribution to calculate the upper and lower limits of a confidence interval for the true mean of amateur scoring using the amateurs in the first round as our sample.

What is the **interpretation** of this confidence interval?\n\n::: column-margin\n\n**TIP**: When interpreting a confidence interval do **not** say \"there is a 90% chance that the true mean is between the lower and upper bounds\". Instead, say \"we are 90% confident that the true mean is between the lower and upper bounds\".\n\n:::\n\n::: column-margin\n\n**TIP**: Only the `t_cv` variable needs to be changed to recompute with the new confidence interval. Use `qt(0.995, df = n - 1)` to calculate the critical value for the new 99% confidence interval.\n:::\n\nRepeat this process with a 99% confidence interval ($\\alpha = .01$).\n\nd. What is the new **lower** bound of the confidence interval?\n\ne. What is the new **upper** bound of the confidence interval?\n\nf. Is this **99% confidence interval** larger, smaller, or the same as **90% confidence interval**?\n\ng. When thinking about your anwer to **f**, what do you think could explain this?\n\n:::\n\n## z-interval for single means\n\nA standard normal distribution (also known as a z-distribution) is used to calculate the confidence interval for a single mean if the sample size is large enough (greater than 30) or the population standard deviation is known. The first case is common as oftentimes samples are greater than 30. The second case is rare because it is uncommon to know the population standard deviation but not the population mean. \n\nThe formula for the confidence interval for a single mean using the z-distribution is very similar to that of the t-distribution\n\n::: column-margin\n\nClick [here](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/standard-normal-distribution/) for more information about the standard normal distribution.\n\n:::\n\n$CI = \\bar{X} \\pm Z_{\\alpha/2} \\times \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$ \n\nWhere $\\bar{X}$ is once again the sample mean,\n$Z_{\\alpha/2}$ is the critical value for the standard normal distribution at the specified confidence level, \n${\\sigma}$ is the population standard deviation, \nand $n$ is the sample size.\n\nThe reasoning behind why we can use the standard normal distribution when the sample is greater than 30 even if the population standard deviation is unknown is found in the [Central Limit Theorem](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/central-limit-theorem/), which says that as the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution. This means that when the sample size is greater than 30 we can use the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation and create a confidence interval as seen below\n\n$CI = \\bar{X} \\pm Z_{\\alpha/2} \\times \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}}$\n\nOnce again the critical value for the z-distribution is the value of $Z_{\\alpha/2}$ such that the area under the standard normal distribution curve between $-Z_{\\alpha/2}$ and $Z_{\\alpha/2}$ is equal to the confidence level.\n\n**R** can compute the z-value for you using the `qnorm()` function. The `qnorm()` function takes in the probability and returns the z-value that corresponds to that probability. For example, `qnorm(.975)` will return the z-value that corresponds to the 97.5th percentile of the standard normal distribution. No degrees of freedom are needed.\n\nThe code below calculates the critical values for the z-distribution for a 95% confidence interval.  \n(Note that .975 is used for a 95% confidence interval because $\\alpha = .05$ and since the confidence interval is two sided we need half of the error each side so $\\alpha / 2  = .025$, which means we want to use `qnorm(.975)` or `qnorm(.025)`)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqnorm(.975)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1.959964\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqnorm(.025)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] -1.959964\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Exercise 3: z-distribution confidence intervals\"}\n\nRun the code below to create the proper subset of the data for this exercise and calculate the sample mean, sample standard deviation, and critical value for the z-distribution.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npga_round1 <- masters_2023 |> \n  filter(round == 1, tour == \"PGA\")\nx_bar <- pga_round1 |> \n  summarise(mean(score)) |> \n  pull()\nsigma <- pga_round1 |> \n  summarise(sd(score)) |> \n  pull()\nz_cv <- qnorm(.975)\n```\n:::\n\n\nUse the formula for creating a confidence interval using the standard normal distribution to calculate the upper and lower limits of a confidence interval for the true mean of PGA professional scoring at Augusta using the PGA pros in the first round as our sample.

What is the **confidence interval** for the true mean of scoring for PGA professionals at Augusta National?\n\nc. What is the **interpretation** of this confidence interval?\n\n:::\n\n## R for Single Mean Confidence Intervals\n\nR functions can help to speed up the process of finding these confidence intervals and will also help us with testing hypotheses later. The `t.test` function from the `stats` package makes a confidence interval for the t-distribution and the `z.test` function from the `BSDA` package does the same for the standard normal distribution.\n\nRun the code below to view what type of arguments these functions take, what they output, and the see some example uses\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n?t.test\n?z.test\n```\n:::\n\n\nThese functions return more than just a confidence interval.

Are these confidence intervals the same as what you calculated manually earlier? If no, why might that be?\n\n:::\n\n# Hypothesis Testing with Single Mean Confidence Intervals\n\nHypothesis testing is a method used to determine if a claim about a population parameter is true or not. In this section, we will perform the most common type of hypothesis test, a single mean test. The null hypothesis ($H_0$) is that the population mean is equal to a specific value, and the alternative hypothesis ($H_a$) is that the population mean is not equal to that value, greater than that value, or less than that value.\n\nNull Hypothesis: $H_0: \\mu = \\mu_0$\n\nAlternative Hypothesis Options: \n\n$H_a: \\mu \\neq \\mu_0$ or\n\n$H_a: \\mu > \\mu_0$ or\n\n$H_a: \\mu < \\mu_0$\n\n\n## Test Statistics\n\nLike confidence intervals, we have two different tests for hypothesis testing for the population mean. Remember that if the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is less than 30, we use the t-distribution. If the population standard deviation is known or the sample size is greater than 30, we use the standard normal distribution.\n\nEach of these distributions have their own tests, the t-test and the z-test. This means that we have different test statistics to calculate depending on the situation.\n\n#### t-test\n\nThe t-test statistic is calculated using the formula:\n\n$$t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}}$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, $\\mu_0$ is the hypothesized population mean, $s$ is the sample standard deviation, and $n$ is the sample size.\n\n#### z-test\n\nThe z-test statistic is calculated using the formula:\n\n$$z = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}}$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, $\\mu_0$ is the hypothesized population mean, $\\sigma$ is the population standard deviation, and $n$ is the sample size.\n\n## To Reject or Fail to Reject\n\nThere are two ways to make a decision about the null hypothesis. \n\n**Method 1**: **Critical values**, along with **test statistics**, can be used to determine if the **hypothesized population mean** is within the **confidence interval** for the true mean.\n\nA **critical value** is a value that separates the rejection region from the non-rejection region. The rejection region is the area where the null hypothesis is rejected. The non-rejection region is the area where the null hypothesis is not rejected. The critical value is determined by the significance level ($\\alpha$) and the degrees of freedom (if it is a t-test). The critical value is compared to the test statistic to determine if the null hypothesis should be rejected. If the test statistic is within the non-rejection region, the null hypothesis is not rejected. If the test statistic is within the rejection region, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted.\n\nBelow is an example of using critical values and a test-statistic for a z-test with a 95% confidence level (two-sided). The critical value is 1.96. This means that if the test statistic is greater than 1.96 or less than -1.96, the null hypothesis is rejected. The blue represents the non-rejection region and the red the rejection region. Since the Test Statistic for this hypothetical example is 1.1 (less than 1.96 and greater than -1.96), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis method corresponds directly to the related confidence intervals produced for the sample data.\n\nIf the hypothesized population mean is within the confidence interval, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. If the hypothesized population mean is not within the confidence interval, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted.\n\n::: column-margin\n\n**Note**: We can say that there is significant evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis if the null hypothesis is rejected. However, it should never be said that we accept the null hypothesis. We can only fail to reject it.\n\n:::\n\n**Method 2**: The second method is to use a p-value. The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as the one calculated from the sample data given that the null hypothesis is true. The p-value is compared to the significance level ($\\alpha$) to determine if the null hypothesis should be rejected. If the p-value is less than $\\alpha$, the null hypothesis is rejected. If the p-value is greater than $\\alpha$, the null hypothesis is not rejected.\n\nFor example, if the p-value for a single mean hypothesis test is 0.03 and the significance level is 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected because the p-value is less than the significance level.\n\n## Hypothesis testing in R\n\nThankfully R can help us with this as well. The `t.test` function and the `z.test` function can both perform hypothesis tests. \n\nThe code below tests if the true mean is not equal to 50 given that the `example_vector` is our sample. The confidence level is set to 95%.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexample_vector <- seq(10, 100, by = 10)\nt.test(example_vector, mu = 50, alternative = \"two.sided\", conf.level = .95)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tOne Sample t-test\n\ndata:  example_vector\nt = 0.52223, df = 9, p-value = 0.6141\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 50\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 33.34149 76.65851\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n       55 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs can be seen in the output of the code above, the p-value is 0.61, which is much greater than the significance level of 0.05. The test-statistic is 0.522 which is within the non-rejection region since critical values for this test would be -2.26 and 2.26. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\n## Hypothesizing Par as the Population Mean\n\n::: column-margin\n\nAugusta National is breathtakingly beautiful, but if golfers get distracted by the scenic views, tall pines, bunkers, water, and azaleas may catch their balls. \n\nThe 13th hole at Augusta National\n![](augusta_13.jpg)\n\nImage Source: [Golf.com](https://golf.com/news/pros-on-new-masters-13th-hole/)\n\n:::\n\nIn golf par is considered to be the number of strokes a good golfer is expected to take.
