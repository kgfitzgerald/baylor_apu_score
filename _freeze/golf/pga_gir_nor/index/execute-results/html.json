If a golfer reaches the green in 2 strokes, they have hit the green in regulation.\n     - On a **par 3** hole, a golfer would be expected to reach the green in 1 stroke\n     - On a **par 5** hole, a golfer would be expected to reach the green in 3 strokes.\n\n\n:::\n\n# Sample Proportions\n\nIn statistics, a sample proportion (denoted $\\hat{p}$) is an estimate of the true proportion of a population. The sample proportion is calculated by dividing the number of successes by the total number of observations in the sample. \n\nThe formula for the sample proportion is:\n$$\\hat{p} = \\frac{x}{n}$$\n\nwhere $x$ is the number of successes and $n$ is the total number of observations in the sample.\n\n::: {.callout-note  title=\"Exercise 1: Sample Proportions\"}\n\nUsing the data below calculate the sample proportion of greens hit in regulation by Scottie Scheffler from different lies.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|player            | year| greens| holes|cut     |\n|:-----------------|----:|------:|-----:|:-------|\n|Scottie Scheffler | 2023|    247|   416|Other   |\n|Scottie Scheffler | 2023|    657|   760|Fairway |\n|Scottie Scheffler | 2023|     28|    48|Bunker  |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\na.

Confidence intervals for proportions can be used for a variety of purposes, including:\n\n1. Quantifying the precision of our estimates. The wider the confidence interval, the less precise our estimate is, the narrower the confidence interval, the more precise our estimate is.\n\n2. Making inferences about the population proportion. For example, if a 90% confidence interval was used, it could be said that if the same population was sampled on numerous occasions and interval estimates were made on each occasion, approximately 90% of the intervals would contain the population parameter.\n\n3. Testing hypothesized values of the population proportion. If the hypothesized value is not within the confidence interval, then we have reason to believe that it is not the true population proportion.\n\n4. Comparing two proportions. If the confidence intervals for two sample proportions do not overlap, then we have reason to believe that the two true population proportions are different.\n\n## Making Confidence Intervals\n\nThe statistical notation for a confidence interval for a proportion is:\n\n$$\n\\hat{p} \\pm z \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\n$$\n\nWhere: \n\n- $\\hat{p}$ is the sample proportion.\n- $z$ is the z-score that corresponds to the desired level of confidence\n- $n$ is the sample size\n\n::: column-margin\n**TIP**: The z-score for a 95% confidence interval is approximately 1.96. You can use this value to calculate the confidence interval for the proportion of greens hit in regulation by Scottie Scheffler from the fairway.\n:::\n\n::: column-margin\nSome common Confidence Intervals (two-sided) and their corresponding z-scores are:\n\n| Confidence Interval | Z-Score |\n|----|----------------------------|\n| 90 % | 1.65 |\n| 95 % | 1.96 |\n| 98 % | 2.33 |\n| 99 % | 2.58 |\n\n:::\n\nFor a quick example if the proportion of success for a problem is .6, the sample size is 100, and the test is being performed at the 95% confidence level, then the confidence interval for the proportion of success can be calculated as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nCI &= \\hat{p} \\pm z \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} \\\\\nCI &= .6 \\pm 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{.6(1-.6)}{100}} \\\\\nCI &= (.50398, .696102) \n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nWe are 95% confident that the true proportion of success is between .50398 and .696102.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Exercise 2: Probability Confidence Intervals\"}\n\nUse the numbers from the data below to calculate a **95% confidence interval** for the proportion of greens hit in regulation by Scottie Scheffler from the fairway. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|player            | year| greens| holes|cut     |\n|:-----------------|----:|------:|-----:|:-------|\n|Scottie Scheffler | 2023|    657|   760|Fairway |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\na.

Explain your answer to part **c**.\n\n:::\n\n# Single Proportion Hypothesis Testing\n\n#### Setting Up Hypotheses\n\nIn hypothesis testing for proportions, a null hypothesis is set up to test a claim about a population proportion. The null hypothesis is that the population proportion is equal to a specific value. The alternative hypothesis can be that the population proportion is not equal to the specific value, greater than the specific value, or less than the specific value. \n\nThe options are shown below: \n\n::: column-margin\n\n**NOTE**: It is common practice to denote a null hypothesis with $H_0$ and an alternative hypothesis with $H_A$. Sometime the alternative hypothesis is denoted with $H_1$.\n\n:::\n\n$H_0: p = p_0$\n\nand \n\n$H_A: p \\neq p_0$ or  \n$H_A: p > p_0$ or  \n$H_A: p < p_0$ \n\nWhere $p_0$ is the hypothesized value of the population proportion and $p$ is the true population proportion.\n\n#### Significance Level\n\nFor hypothesis testing, a **significance level** is set to determine the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. The significance level is denoted by $\\alpha$ and is often set to 0.05. This means that there is a 5% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. Other common **significance levels** are 0.01 and 0.10.\n\n#### Calculating the Test Statistic\n\nA **test statistic** is a value calculated from the sample data that is used to determine whether the null hypothesis should be rejected or not.\n\n::: column-margin\n**NOTE**: The standard normal distribution is used to determine the critical value and test statistic for hypothesis testing for proportions. The standard normal distribution is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The distribution is symmetric about the mean and has a bell-shaped curve. The standard normal distribution is often called the z-distribution.\n:::\n\nThe **test statistic** for hypothesis testing for proportions is **z**,\nand the formula for it is as follows:\n\n$$z = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p_0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p_0(1 - p_0)}{n}}}$$\n\nWhere $\\hat{p}$ is the sample proportion, $p_0$ is the hypothesized value of the population proportion, and $n$ is the sample size. \n\n#### Determining the Significance of the Test\n\nThere are two common ways to determine the significance of the test:\n\n1. Compare the test statistic to the critical value\n\n2. Compare the p-value to the significance level\n\nThe first method compares the **test statistic** to the **critical value**. The critical value is the value that separates the rejection region from the non-rejection region. If the test statistic is in the rejection region, the null hypothesis is rejected. This also corresponds to the confidence intervals given for the true probability of success. If the hypothesized value of the population proportion is within the confidence interval, the null hypothesis is not rejected. If it is outside the confidence interval, the null hypothesis is rejected.\n\nThe **p-value** is the most common way to determine the significance of the test. The **p-value** is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as the one calculated from the sample data, assuming the null hypothesis is true. If the **p-value** is less than the significance level, the null hypothesis is rejected. \n\n::: column-margin\n**TIP**: Tables of z-scores and p-values like the one below can be used to determine the significance of the test. These tables show the area under the normal curve to the left of a given z-score.\n\n![](z-table.png)\n\n:::\n\n#### Hypothesis Testing Example\n\nBelow is an example of hypothesis testing for proportions. First, we will set up the hypotheses:\n\n$$H_0: p = 0.7$$\n$$H_A: p \\neq 0.7$$\nThe significance level is set to 0.05.\n\nOur sample data has 60 successes out of 100 trials. The sample proportion is $\\hat{p} = 0.6$.\n\nThe test statistic is calculated as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nz &= \\frac{0.6 - 0.7}{\\sqrt{\\frac{0.7(1 - 0.7)}{100}}} \\\\\nz &= \\frac{-0.1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{0.21}{100}}} \\\\ \nz &= \\frac{-0.1}{0.045826} \\\\\nz &= -2.183215\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSince alpha was set to 0.05, the critical value is $\\pm 1.96$. Since the test statistic is less than -1.96, the null hypothesis is rejected.\n\nIf we wanted to find the p-value, we would look up the z-score in a z-table. The area under the normal curve to the left of -2.183215 is 0.0146. Since this is a two-tailed test, the p-value is 0.0146 * 2 = 0.0292. Since the p-value is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected.\n\nThere is enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis that the population proportion is not equal to 0.7.\n\n#### Drawing Conclusions\n\nIf the null hypothesis is rejected we can conclude that the sample data provides enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis. If the null hypothesis was that the population proportion is equal to .7 and the alternative hypothesis was that the population proportion is not equal to .7 and $\\alpha = 0.5$, then we might say, \n\n*\"There is significant evidence to suggest that the true population proportion is not equal to .7 at the 95% confidence level.\"*\n\nIf the null hypothesis is not rejected we do not automatically accept the null hypothesis. We simply do not have enough evidence to reject it. For example, if the null hypothesis was that the population proportion is equal to .7 and the alternative hypothesis was that the population proportion is not equal to .7 and $\\alpha = .05$, then we might say,\n\n*There is not enough evidence to suggest that the true population proportion is different from .7 at the 95% confidence level.\"*\n\n#### Testing a Hypothesized Proportion\n\nSuppose you are watching a golf tournament on TV and Scottie Scheffler is about to hit an approach shot from the fairway. You hear the announcer say that Scottie Scheffler hits 3/4 of his greens in regulation from the fairway. You are skeptical of this claim and decide to test it against the data you have collected at the 95% confidence level.\n\nYou set up a hypothesis test with the following hypotheses:\n\n- **Null Hypothesis $H_0$**: The proportion of greens hit in regulation by Scottie Scheffler from the fairway is 0.75.\n\n- **Alternative Hypothesis $H_A$**: The proportion of greens hit in regulation by Scottie Scheffler from the fairway is not 0.75.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Exercise 4: Single Proportion Hypothesis Testing\"}\n\nUse the formula for a one sample z-test for a proportion to perform a hypothesis test for the proportion of greens hit in regulation by Scottie Scheffler from the fairway.\n\na. What is the value of the **test statistic**?\n\nb. What are the **critical values** for the test?\n\nc. What is the **p-value** of the test?\n\nb. Do you reject or fail to reject the **null hypothesis**?\n\nc. What is your **conclusion**?\n\n:::\n\n# Two Sample z-test for Proportions\n\nSometimes, comparing two sample proportions is necessary to determine if they are significantly different. This can be done with a two sample z-test for equality of proportions.\n\nThe null hypothesis for a two sample z-test for equality of proportions is that the two proportions are equal.\n\n$H_0: p_1 = p_2$\n\nThe alternative hypothesis can be that the two proportions are not equal, that the first proportion is greater than the second proportion, or that the first proportion is less than the second proportion. The options for the alternative hypothesis are shown below:\n\n$H_A: p_1 \\neq p_2$  \n$H_A: p_1 > p_2$  \n$H_A: p_1 < p_2$\n\nThe test-statistic for the two sample z-test for equality of proportions is calculated as:\n\n$$Z = \\frac{\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2}{\\sqrt{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})\\left(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}\\right)}}$$\n\nwhere\n\n$\\hat{p}_1$ and $\\hat{p}_2$ are the sample proportions for the two samples,\n\n$\\hat{p}$ is the pooled proportion,\n\n$n_1$ and $n_2$ are the sample sizes for the two samples.\n\nThe pooled proportion is calculated as:\n\n$$\\hat{p} = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{n_1 + n_2}$$\n\n#### Comparing Two Proportions Example\n\nSuppose you collect two samples of greens hit in regulation by two different golfers. Golfer A hits 10 out of 100 greens in regulation, while Golfer B hits 20 out of 100 greens in regulation. You want to test if the two golfers have significantly different greens hit in regulation at the 95% confidence level.\n\nThe hypotheses for the test are:\n$$H_0: p_1 = p_2$$\n$$H_A: p_1 \\neq p_2$$\n\nThe test statistic is calculated as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nz &= \\frac{\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2}{\\sqrt{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})\\left(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}\\right)}} \\\\ \nz &= \\frac{0.1 - 0.2}{\\sqrt{0.15(1 - 0.15)\\left(\\frac{1}{100} + \\frac{1}{100}\\right)}} \\\\\nz &= \\frac{-0.1}{\\sqrt{0.15(0.85)\\left(0.02\\right)}} \\\\\nz &= \\frac{-0.1}{\\sqrt{0.00255}} \\\\\nz &= \\frac{-0.1}{0.05050} \\\\\nz &= -1.98030\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSince alpha was set to 0.05, the critical value is $\\pm 1.96$. Since the test statistic is less than -1.96 (just barely), the null hypothesis is rejected. There is enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis that the two golfers have significantly different greens hit in regulation proportions.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Exercise 6: Comparing Two Proportions\"}\n\nOf the cuts in golf, the **fairway** is generally considered to be the most desirable place to hit the ball. Shorter grass is widely believed to make it easier to hit the green in regulation. \n\nThe **bunker**, on the other hand, is often considered to be one of the most difficult places to hit the ball from. The sand can make it difficult to control the ball and hit it accurately. Additionally, no practice swings are allowed to hit the sand in the **bunker** making it more difficult to get a feel for the shot.\n\n::: column-margin\n\nLearn about rules about hitting out of the bunkers in golf in the video below:\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/T9_gXqAE6ZY >}}\n\n\n\n:::\n\nIn the data there is also a cut called **\"Other\"**. This includes shots from the rough, waste areas, mulch and more. These are also often expected to be tougher than the fairway but slightly easier to hit out of than bunkers, but not always. Our summarization of the probabilities from different cuts earlier confirmed a slightly higher probability of hitting the green in regulation from the **\"Other\"** cut compared to the bunker cut.\n\nUse the formula for comparing two proportions to compare the proportion of greens hit in regulation by Scottie Scheffler from the **fairway** and the **bunker**. Make the alternative hypothesis that the proportion of greens hit in regulation from the fairway is **greater** than the proportion of greens hit in regulation from the bunker. Use the **95% confidence level**.\n\n:::column-margin\n\n**TIP**: When the alternative hypothesis is that the proportion from the first sample is greater than the proportion from the second sample, the test is a **one-tailed test**, meaning all of the error is in one tail of the distribution. This also means that the critical value of a one-tailed test at the 95% confidence level is the same as a two-tailed test at the 90% confidence level.\n\n:::\n\na.

Scottie Scheffler skyrocketed up the world golf rankings from 2019-2023. His world golf ranking went from 66 to 31 to 12 to 2 and finally to number 1 (at the end of each season respectively). Take a look at whether Scottie Scheffler's greens in regulation from different cuts improved during his climb to the top. This can be seen below.\n\n::: column-margin\n<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\n\nBelow is a graph of Scottie Scheffler's rapid climb up the world golf rankings from the end of 2019 to the end of 2023.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|player            | year| greens| holes|cut     |\n|:-----------------|----:|------:|-----:|:-------|\n|Scottie Scheffler | 2020|    205|   372|Other   |\n|Scottie Scheffler | 2020|    563|   703|Fairway |\n|Scottie Scheffler | 2020|     39|    73|Bunker  |\n|Scottie Scheffler | 2021|    232|   430|Other   |\n|Scottie Scheffler | 2021|    684|   866|Fairway |\n|Scottie Scheffler | 2021|     35|    68|Bunker  |\n|Scottie Scheffler | 2022|    227|   399|Other   |\n|Scottie Scheffler | 2022|    592|   704|Fairway |\n|Scottie Scheffler | 2022|     42|    71|Bunker  |\n|Scottie Scheffler | 2023|    247|   416|Other   |\n|Scottie Scheffler | 2023|    657|   760|Fairway |\n|Scottie Scheffler | 2023|     28|    48|Bunker  |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n    \na. Calculate Scheffler's GIR from the fairway each season. Which season is it the highest?\n    \nb. Which season is it the lowest?\n    \nc. Use the formula to compare the proportion of greens hit in regulation by Scottie Scheffler from the **fairway** in 2020 to the proportion of greens hit in regulation by Scottie Scheffler from the **fairway** in 2021. Make the alternative hypothesis that the proportion of greens hit in regulation from the fairway by Scottie Scheffler in 2020 is less than the proportion of greens hit in regulation from the fairway by Scottie Scheffler in 2021.
