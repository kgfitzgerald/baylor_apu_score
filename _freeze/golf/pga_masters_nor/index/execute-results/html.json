The Masters is considered to be one of the greatest and most selective tournaments in the world of golf. Only the best current players or previous winners are allowed in. The winner of the Masters gets to wear the famed \"Green Jacket\" and return to play any year they would like at the Masters. The course the Masters is played at, Augusta National, is one of the most beautiful and challenging courses in the world. The course is known for its fast greens and tight fairways. The Masters is the first major of the year and is played in early April. The tournament is played over four days. After 2 days, the top 50 players and ties make the cut and play the final two days. \n\n::: column-margin\n![Master's Leaderboard](Augusta_Leaderboard.jpg)\n\nImage Source: <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Augusta_National_Leaderboard_(17071936729).jpg\">Ryan Schreiber</a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0\">CC BY 2.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons\n:::\n\n::: column-margin\n\nView the course at Augusta National [here](https://www.masters.com/en_US/course/index.html)\n\n:::\n\n\nAs mentioned before, only the best players and previous winners can compete in the tournament. With that being said, the Masters is one of the few tournaments that players from the newly created LIV golf tour can play in, although they are mostly qualifying because of their past performances at the Masters before they joined LIV golf. This leads to a mixture of regular PGA Tour professionals, LIV golfers, Amateurs, and Seniors playing in the Masters in 2023. \n\n\nThe focus for this module is confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for the true mean scores for different groups of players at Augusta National. \n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Learning Objectives\" appearance=\"minimal\"}\nBy the end of this module, you will be able to:\n\n-   Make single mean confidence intervals\n\n-   Perform a hypothesis test for a single mean\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" title=\"Research Questions\"}\n\nDuring this lab, you'll investigate the following research questions:\n\n+ What are the confidence intervals for scoring for different groups of players at the 2023 Masters Tournament?\n+ Is the true mean for different groups of players at the 2023 Masters different than par?\n+ Is the true scoring average for amateurs greater than par at Augusta National?\n+ How do sample size and confidence level affect the width of a confidence interval?\n\n:::\n\n# Getting started: 2023 Masters Data\n\nThe data for this lab comes from the 2023 Masters tournament. The data includes the name of golfer, the round of the tournament, the score the round, and the tour that they usually play on.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" title=\"Data Description\"}\n\n| Variable | Description |\n|----|----------------------------|\n| `player` | Golfer's name |\n| `round` | Round of the tournament |\n| `score` | Score for the 18-hole course |\n| `tour` | The tour the player generally competes on |\n:::\n\n## Terms to know\n\nBefore proceeding with the analysis, let's make sure we know some important golf terminology that will help us master this lab.\n\n#### Golf Terminology\n-   **Par** in golf is the amount of strokes that a good golfer is expected to take to get the ball in the hole.\n    - Each **hole** in golf has its own **par**. There are **par 3** holes, **par 4** holes, and **par 5** holes. \n    - There are 18 holes on a golf course and the **pars** of each of these holes sums to **par for the course**, also known the **course par**. \n-   A **round** in golf is when a golfer plays the full set of 18 holes on the course.\n    - In most professional golf tournaments, all golfers play **2 rounds**, the best golfers are selected and those golfers play 2 more rounds for a total of **4 rounds**.\n\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\n#### Types of Golf Tours\n- In golf there are a few **tours**, better thought of as leagues, that golfers regularly compete in\n\n     -  The **PGA Tour**, or \"Professional Golf Association Tour\", has long been considered the preeminant golfing tour, hosting most tournaments and containing the most skilled members.\n     - The **LIV** tour is a Saudi-backed alternative to the PGA that played its first season in 2022. **LIV** is the Roman numeral for 54 and is related to the fact that **LIV** tournaments only allow 54 players and only play 54 holes, compared to the normal PGA Tour 72 holes.\n     - The **PGA Tour Champions** is a branch off of the PGA tour for players 50 or older. It used to be called the \"Senior PGA Tour\" until 2003, when it began being called the **Champions** tour\n     - An **amateur** is a golfer who is not yet a professional. They are not allowed to win money in professional golf tournaments. Most **amateurs** are college golfers. \n\n:::\n\n::: column-margin\n\nPGA Tour vs. LIV Golf\n\nClick [here](https://www.si.com/golf/news/timeline-liv-golf-how-pga-tour-adapted) to read about LIV golf's founding and its continued impact on the PGA tour.\n\n:::\n\n\n# Single Mean Confidence Intervals\n\nSingle mean confidence intervals give a range of numbers that we can feel confident that the true population mean falls between. \nIn the most accurate sense, a single mean confidence interval is a range of values that,\nif we were to take many samples and calculate the confidence interval for each sample,\na certain percentage of those intervals would contain the true population mean.\nBecause of what a single mean confidence interval is, it is innaccurate to say that there is \na 95% chance (if we were constructing a 95% confidence interval) that the true mean falls within the the confidence interval. The true mean is a fixed value,\nso it either falls within the interval or it does not. The 95% confidence level refers to the long-run proportion of confidence intervals\nthat will contain the true mean if we were to take many samples.This can lead to difficulties interpreting\nthese ranges in practice though. An accurate interpretation of a single mean confidence interval will often follow the structure below:\n\n**We are *(insert confidence level)* confident that the true *(insert variable)* mean for *(insert population group)* is between *(insert lower bound)* and *(insert upper bound)*.**\n\n\nFor example:\n\n  **We are 95% confident that the true scoring average for LIV golfers at Augusta National is between 70.1 and 73.3.**\n  \n\nThere are two different ways of calculating the confidence interval for a single mean. How we\ndetermine which of the two methods to use is based on the sample size and whether\nor not the population standard deviation is known. \n\n\n## t-interval for single means\n\nA t-distribution is used for calculating a single mean confidence interval if the sample size is small (rule of thumb: less than 30) and the population standard deviation is unknown. \n\nThe formula for calculating a CI using this method is shown below:\n$$CI = \\bar{x} \\pm t_{\\alpha/2, df} \\times \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\n\n::: column-margin\n\nClick [here](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/t-distribution/) to learn more about the t-distribution and play around with t-distribution graphs.\n\n:::\n\nWhere $\\bar{X}$ is the sample mean,\n\n$t_{\\alpha/2, df}$ is the critical value for the t-distribution\nwith $df = n-1$,\n\n$S$ is the sample standard deviation,\n\nand $n$ is the sample size.\n\n::: column-margin\n\n**NOTE**: The t-distribution changes based on the degrees of freedom, approaching the normal distribution as the degrees of freedom increase.\n\n:::\n\nThe critical value for the t-distribution is determined by the confidence level and the degrees of freedom. This is calculated by finding the value of $t_{\\alpha/2, df}$ such that the area under the t-distribution curve (with that specific degrees of freedom) between $-t_{\\alpha/2, df}$ and $t_{\\alpha/2, df}$ is equal to the confidence level. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThese critical values can be found using t-tables like the one below. Some important things to note about this specific t-table. The degrees of freedom for the test are on the left. The row *cum. prob* at the top shows us the $t_{\\alpha}$ value. The *one-tail* row shows us the p-value for a one-tailed test and the row *two-tail* shows us the p-value for a two-tailed test. There is also a helpful row at the bottom called *confidence level* that shows the associated confidence level for confidence intervals. The values in the table show the t-test statistic values corresponding to the degrees of freedom and $t_{alpha}$. \n\n![](t-table.png)\n\nFor a 95% confidence interval, our Type I error rate is $\\alpha = 0.05$. Since confidence intervals are two-tailed, we split this $\\alpha$ in half, half in the left tail and half in the right tail. This means that we are looking for $t_{.025, df}$ or $t_{.975, df}$.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" title=\"Example 1: t-distribution confidence intervals\"}\nWe would like to make a 90% confidence interval for the true mean of scoring for Jon Rahm at the Masters. His scores were as follows. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Golfer   | Round| Score|\n|:--------|-----:|-----:|\n|Jon Rahm |     1|    65|\n|Jon Rahm |     2|    69|\n|Jon Rahm |     3|    73|\n|Jon Rahm |     4|    69|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe start by calculating the the sample mean ($\\bar{x}$).\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\bar{x} &= \\frac{65 + 69 + 73 + 69}{4} \\\\\n        &= 69\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNext we calculate the sample standard deviation ($s$).\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ns &= {\\sqrt {\\frac {\\sum _{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-{\\overline {x}})^{2}}{n-1}}} \\\\\n  &= {\\sqrt {\\frac{(65 - 69)^2 + (69 - 69)^2 + (73 - 69)^2 + (69 - 69)^2}{4-1}}} \\\\\n  &= {\\sqrt {\\frac{(-4)^2 + 0^2 + 4^2 + 0^2}{3}}} \\\\\n  &\\approx 3.266\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nOur next step is to find the critical value for a 90% confidence interval with 3 degrees of freedom ($t_{\\alpha/2, df}$. We'll use the t-table from earlier to find this.\n\n![](t-table-with-arrows.png)\n\nLastly we will use the confidence interval formula to find the bounds of our 90% confidence interval.\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nCI &= \\bar{x} \\pm t_{\\alpha/2, df} \\times \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\\\\nCI &= 69 \\pm 2.353 \\times \\frac{3.266}{\\sqrt{4}} \\\\\nCI &= (67.07878, 70.92122)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nFinally we can interpret the confidence interval and say that we are 95% confident that the true mean of Jon Rahm's scores at Augusta National is between 67.1 and 70.9. \n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Exercise 1: t-distribution confidence intervals\"}\n\nThe table below shows summary data for the first round of the 2023 Masters tournament for amateur golfers.

Instead, say \"we are 90% confident that the true mean is between the lower and upper bounds\".\n\n:::\n\n::: column-margin\n\n**TIP**: The t-table from earlier in the lesson will need to be used to find the critical value for the t-distribution for a 99% confidence interval with 6 degrees of freedom.\n:::\n\nRepeat this process with a 99% confidence interval ($\\alpha = .01$).\n\nd. What is the new **lower** bound of the confidence interval?\n\ne. What is the new **upper** bound of the confidence interval?\n\nf. Is this **99% confidence interval** larger, smaller, or the same as **90% confidence interval**?\n\ng. When thinking about your anwer to **f**, what do you think could explain this?\n\n:::\n\n## z-interval for single means\n\nA standard normal distribution (also known as a z-distribution) is used to calculate the confidence interval for a single mean if the sample size is large enough (greater than 30) or the population standard deviation is known. The first case is common as oftentimes samples are greater than 30. The second case is rare because it is uncommon to know the population standard deviation but not the population mean. \n\nThe formula for the confidence interval for a single mean using the z-distribution is very similar to that of the t-distribution\n\n::: column-margin\n\nClick [here](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/standard-normal-distribution/) for more information about the standard normal distribution.\n\n:::\n\n$CI = \\bar{X} \\pm Z_{\\alpha/2} \\times \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$ \n\nWhere $\\bar{X}$ is once again the sample mean,\n$Z_{\\alpha/2}$ is the critical value for the standard normal distribution at the specified confidence level, \n${\\sigma}$ is the population standard deviation, \nand $n$ is the sample size.\n\nThe reasoning behind why we can use the standard normal distribution when the sample is greater than 30 even if the population standard deviation is unknown is found in the [Central Limit Theorem](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/central-limit-theorem/), which says that as the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution. This means that when the sample size is greater than 30 we can use the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation and create a confidence interval as seen below\n\n$CI = \\bar{X} \\pm Z_{\\alpha/2} \\times \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}$\n\nOnce again the critical value for the z-distribution is the value of $Z_{\\alpha/2}$ such that the area under the standard normal distribution curve between $-Z_{\\alpha/2}$ and $Z_{\\alpha/2}$ is equal to the confidence level.\n\nThe critical values for the z-distribution can be found using a z-table such as the one below. All values in the table are the area under the standard normal curve to the left of the associated z-score. The column on the left shows the associated ones and tenths value for the z-score. The row at the top shows the associated hundredths value for the z-score.\n\n![](z-table.png)\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" title=\"Example 2: z-distribution confidence intervals\"}\nWe would like to make a 98% confidence interval for the true mean of scoring for PGA Tour golfers based off \nof a sample from the third round. The sample includes the following scores.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRound 3 PGA Tour golfer scores: 73 76 71 75 70 73 71 72 71 74 73 68 74 67 73 73 70 72 74 74 69 73 74 74 72 78 74 76 74 72 77 70 74 77 72 73 74 74 77\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWhew! That's 39 observations we have in our sample, which means we can use the z-distribution.\n\nWe start by calculating the the sample mean ($\\bar{x}$). This probably has to be done using \na calculator or programming tool. For this example our sample mean is approximately \n73.03. \n\nNext we calculate the sample standard deviation ($s$), which is our estimate for $\\sigma$. Once again, with a sample this \nsize a calculator or computer is probably necessary for computing this. Our sample \nstandard deviation is approximately 2.44.\n\nOur next step is to find the critical value for a 98% confidence interval for a \nz-distribution ($Z_{\\alpha/2}$). We will use the z-table from earlier. Since we want alpha equal to .2, our area to the right should be .1 and we look for the value on the table of .99.\n\n![](z-table-with-arrows.png)\n\nNote that this value is not exact. The value is slightly less than 2.33\nbut .9901 is closer to .99 than .9898, so we went with 2.33.\n\nLastly we will use the confidence interval formula to find the bounds for our 98% confidence interval.\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nCI &= \\bar{X} \\pm Z_{\\alpha/2} \\times \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\\\\nCI &= 73.03 \\pm 2.33 \\times \\frac{2.44}{\\sqrt{39}} \\\\\nCI &= (72.12, 73.94)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nFinally we can interpret the confidence interval and say that we are 98% confident that the true mean of PGA Tour golfers' scores at the 2023 Masters is between 72.12 and 73.94. \n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Exercise 2: z-distribution confidence intervals\"}\n\nThe table below shows summary data for the first round of the 2023 Masters Tournament for PGA professional golfers.

What is the **confidence interval** for the true mean of scoring for PGA professionals at Augusta National using round 1 as our sample?\n\nc. What is the **interpretation** of this confidence interval?\n\n:::\n\n# Hypothesis Testing with Single Mean Confidence Intervals\n\nHypothesis testing is a method used to determine if a claim about a population parameter is true or not. In this section, we will perform the most common type of hypothesis test, a single mean test. The null hypothesis ($H_0$) is that the population mean is equal to a specific value, and the alternative hypothesis ($H_a$) is that the population mean is not equal to that value, greater than that value, or less than that value.\n\nNull Hypothesis: $H_0: \\mu = \\mu_0$\n\nAlternative Hypothesis Options: \n\n$H_a: \\mu \\neq \\mu_0$ or\n\n$H_a: \\mu > \\mu_0$ or\n\n$H_a: \\mu < \\mu_0$\n\n\n## Test Statistics\n\nLike confidence intervals, we have two different tests for hypothesis testing for the population mean. Remember that if the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is less than 30, we use the t-distribution. If the population standard deviation is known or the sample size is greater than 30, we use the standard normal distribution.\n\nEach of these distributions have their own tests, the t-test and the z-test. This means that we have different test statistics to calculate depending on the situation.\n\n#### t-test\n\nThe t-test statistic is calculated using the formula:\n\n$$t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}}$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, $\\mu_0$ is the hypothesized population mean, $s$ is the sample standard deviation, and $n$ is the sample size.\n\n#### z-test\n\nThe z-test statistic is calculated using the formula:\n\n$$z = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}}$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, $\\mu_0$ is the hypothesized population mean, $\\sigma$ is the population standard deviation, and $n$ is the sample size.\n\nOnce again, if the sample size is over 30 and the population standard deviation is unknown, we use the sample standard deviation to approximate the population standard deviation.\n\n## To Reject or Fail to Reject\n\nThere are two ways to make a decision about the null hypothesis. \n\n**Method 1**: **Critical values**, along with **test statistics**, can be used to determine if the **hypothesized population mean** is within the **confidence interval** for the true mean.\n\nA **critical value** is a value that separates the rejection region from the non-rejection region. The rejection region is the area where the null hypothesis is rejected. The non-rejection region is the area where the null hypothesis is not rejected. The critical value is determined by the significance level ($\\alpha$) and the degrees of freedom (if it is a t-test). The critical value is compared to the test statistic to determine if the null hypothesis should be rejected. If the test statistic is within the non-rejection region, the null hypothesis is not rejected. If the test statistic is within the rejection region, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted.\n\n\nBelow is an example of using critical values and a test-statistic for a z-test with a 95% confidence level (two-sided). The critical value is 1.96. This means that if the test statistic is greater than 1.96 or less than -1.96, the null hypothesis is rejected. The blue represents the non-rejection region and the red the rejection region. Since the test statistic for this example is 1.1 (less than 1.96 and greater than -1.96), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis method corresponds directly to the related confidence intervals produced for the sample data.\n\nIf the hypothesized population mean is within the confidence interval, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. If the hypothesized population mean is not within the confidence interval, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted.\n\n::: column-margin\n\n**Note**: We can say that there is significant evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis if the null hypothesis is rejected. However, it should never be said that we accept the null hypothesis. We can only fail to reject it.\n\n:::\n\n**Method 2**: The second method is to use a p-value. The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as the one calculated from the sample data given that the null hypothesis is true. The p-value is compared to the significance level ($\\alpha$) to determine if the null hypothesis should be rejected. If the p-value is less than $\\alpha$, the null hypothesis is rejected. If the p-value is greater than $\\alpha$, the null hypothesis is not rejected.\n\n::: column-margin\n**NOTE**: Our **alternative hypothesis** determines whether we are looking for the probability that the test statistic is greater than or less than the observed value. \n\n- For a **two-sided test**, the p-value is the probability that the test statistic is greater than the observed value or less than the negative of the observed value. Find the area in one of the tails and double it.\n\n- For a **left-tailed test** ($H_a: \\mu < \\mu_0$), the p-value is the probability that the test statistic is less than the observed value.\n\n- For a **right-tailed test** ($H_a: \\mu > \\mu_0$), the p-value is the probability that the test statistic is greater than the observed value.\n:::\n\nFirst let's visualize what a p-value is telling us. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNow let's see how we can calculate p-value for our example using a z-table. \n\nWe have a hypothetical z-test statistic of 1.1 and alpha of .05 for a two-tailed test.\nWe start by finding the area under the curve to the left of a z-score of 1.1. However, we know that we want the area under the curve greater than 1.1 or less than -1.1. We can find the area under the curve to the right of 1.1 by subtracting our area value from 1. Additionally, we know that the z-distribution is symmetrical, implying that the area under the curve less than -1.1 is equal to that which is greater than 1.1. This means that we multiply our area value by 2 to get the p-value.\n\n![](z-table-pvalue-arrows.png)\n\nThis means we can calculate p-value with the math below.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\np\\text{-}value &= 2 * (1 - .8643)\\\\\n               &= .2714\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSince the p-value is greater than our alpha value of .05 we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" title=\"Example 3: Hypothesis testing example\"}\n\nSuppose we have a sample of data with the following values: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100. We want to test if the true mean of the population is not equal to 50. Alpha is 0.05. Our hypotheses are as follows:\n\n- Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): $\\mu = 50$\n- Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$): $\\mu \\neq 50$\n\nWe should use the t-test to test this hypothesis because the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown.\n\nWe start by finding the sample mean, sample standard deviation, and degrees of freedom. \nUsing a calculator we can find $\\bar{x} = 55$, $s = 30.2765$, and logically $df = 9$.\n\nNow we need to find the critical value for a 95% two sided confidence t-interval with 9 degrees of freedom ($t_{\\alpha/2, df}$). Once again we will use the t-table from earlier. \n\n![](t-table-hypothesis-arrows.png)\n\nThe critical value is $\\pm 2.262$.\n\n\nNext the test statistic can be calculated as follows:\n\n$$t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}}$$\n$$t = \\frac{55 - 50}{\\frac{30.2765}{\\sqrt{10}}}$$\n$$t = 0.522$$\n\nThis is visualized in the plot below.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nSince the test statistic is between the two critical values, there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the true mean is not equal to 50.\n\nThe p-value for this example could be calculated by finding the area\nunder the curve to the left of -0.522 and to the right of 0.522. The p-value would be the sum of these two areas.\n\nThis value can be estimated by looking at the t-table. Obviously .522 is not on the table, but is between 0 and .703. If we follow this up to the top of the table we can look at the two-tails column and see that the p-value would be between .5 and 1. This is significantly larger than .05. Therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\n![](t-table-pvalue-arrows.png)\n\n::: column-margin\n**NOTE**: Since this is a two-sided test you could simply find the probability that the test statistic is greater than 0.522 and multiply by 2. This would give you the **p-value**.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Hypothesizing Par as the Population Mean\n\n::: column-margin\n\nAugusta National is breathtakingly beautiful, but if golfers get distracted by the scenic views, tall pines, bunkers, water, and azaleas may catch their balls. \n\n![Augusta Hole 13](augusta-national-13.jpg)\n\nImage Source: [Your Golf Travel](https://www.yourgolftravel.com/golf-architects/alister-mackenzie-golf-courses), [CC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)\n\n:::\n\nIn golf par is considered to be the number of strokes a good golfer is expected to take.

You have learned when to use a z-distribution and when to use a t-distribution. How to interpret p-values and confidence intervals was also covered.\n\nWith the Masters scoring data, you were able to calculate confidence intervals and test hypotheses about the mean score of different groups of golfers. We saw that in order to form confidence intervals for groups such as amateurs and seniors, we needed to use the t-distribution due to the small sample sizes. With larger sample sizes, such as the PGA golfers, we were able to use the z-distribution. These confidence intervals gave us a range of plausible values for the true mean score of each group. We also tested hypotheses about the mean scoring averages for PGA, LIV, and amateur golfers. We were able to make conclusions about the mean score of each group (whether or not that group's mean was greater than or not equal to par) based on the test statistic and critical values or p-values.",
