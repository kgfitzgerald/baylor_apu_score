The Masters is considered to be one of the greatest and most selective tournaments in the world of golf. Only the best current players or previous winners are allowed in. The winner of the Masters gets to wear the famed \"Green Jacket\" and return to play any year they would like at the Masters. The course the Masters is played at, Augusta National, is one of the most beautiful and challenging courses in the world. The course is known for its fast greens and tight fairways. The Masters is the first major of the year and is played in early April. The tournament is played over four days. After 2 days, the top 50 players and ties make the cut and play the final two days. \n\n::: column-margin\n![Master's Leaderboard](Augusta_Leaderboard.jpg)\n\nImage Source: <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Augusta_National_Leaderboard_(17071936729).jpg\">Ryan Schreiber</a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0\">CC BY 2.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons\n:::\n\n::: column-margin\n\nView the course at Augusta National [here](https://www.masters.com/en_US/course/index.html)\n\n:::\n\n\nAs mentioned before, only the best players and previous winners can compete in the tournament. With that being said, the Masters is one of the few tournaments that players from the newly created LIV golf tour can play in, although they are mostly qualifying because of their past performances at the Masters before they joined LIV golf. This leads to a mixture of regular PGA professionals, LIV professionals, Amateurs, and Seniors playing in the Masters in 2023. \n\n\nThe focus for this module is confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for the true mean scores for different groups of players at Augusta National. \n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Learning Objectives\" appearance=\"minimal\"}\nBy the end of this module, you will be able to:\n\n-   Make single mean confidence intervals\n\n-   Perform a hypothesis test for a single mean\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" title=\"Research Questions\"}\n\nDuring this lab, you'll investigate the following research questions:\n\n+ What are the confidence intervals for scoring for different groups of players at the 2023 Masters Tournament?\n+ Is the true mean for different groups of players at the 2023 Masters different than par?\n+ Is the true scoring average for amateurs greater than par at Augusta National?\n+ How do sample size and confidence level affect the width of a confidence interval?\n\n:::\n\n# Getting started: 2023 Masters Data\n\nThe data for this lab comes from the 2023 Masters tournament. The data includes the name of golfer, the round of the tournament, the score the round, and the tour that they usually play on.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" title=\"Data Description\"}\n\n| Variable | Description |\n|----|----------------------------|\n| `player` | Golfer's name |\n| `round` | Round of the tournament |\n| `score` | Score for the 18-hole course |\n| `tour` | The tour the player generally competes on |\n:::\n\n## Terms to know\n\nBefore proceeding with the analysis, let's make sure we know some important golf terminology that will help us master this lab.\n\n#### Golf Terminology\n-   **Par** in golf is the amount of strokes that a good golfer is expected to take to get the ball in the hole.\n    - Each **hole** in golf has its own **par**. There are **par 3** holes, **par 4** holes, and **par 5** holes. \n    - There are 18 holes on a golf course and the **pars** of each of these holes sums to **par for the course**, also known the **course par**. \n-   A **round** in golf is when a golfer plays the full set of 18 holes on the course.\n    - In most professional golf tournaments, all golfers play **2 rounds**, the best golfers are selected and those golfers play 2 more rounds for a total of **4 rounds**.\n\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\n#### Types of Golf Tours\n- In golf there are a few **tours**, better thought of as leagues, that golfers regularly compete in\n\n     -  The **PGA**, or \"Professional Golf Association\", has long been considered the preeminant golfing tour, hosting most tournaments and containing the most skilled members.\n     - The **LIV** tour is a Saudi-backed alternative to the PGA that was played its first season in 2022. **LIV** is the Roman numeral for 54 and is related to the fact that **LIV** tournaments only allow 54 players and only play 54 holes, compared to the normal PGA 72 holes.\n     - The **PGA Tour Champions** is a branch off of the PGA tour for players 50 or older. It used to be called the \"Senior PGA Tour\" until 2003, when it began being called the **Champions** tour\n     - An **amateur** is a golfer who is not yet a professional. They are not allowed to win money in professional golf tournaments. Most **amateurs** are college golfers. \n\n:::\n\n::: column-margin\n\nPGA vs. LIV\n\nClick [here](https://www.si.com/golf/news/timeline-liv-golf-how-pga-tour-adapted) to read about LIV golf's founding and its continued impact on the PGA tour.\n\n:::\n\n\n# Single Mean Confidence Intervals\n\nSingle Mean confidence intervals give a range of numbers that we can feel confident that the true population mean falls between. \n\nThere are two different ways of calculating the confidence interval for a single mean. \n\n## t-interval for single means\n\nA t-distribution is used for calculating a single mean confidence interval if the sample size is small (rule of thumb: less than 30) and the population standard deviation is unknown. \n\nThe formula for calculating a CI using this method is shown below:\n$$CI = \\bar{X} \\pm t_{\\alpha/2, df} \\times \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\n\n::: column-margin\n\nClick [here](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/t-distribution/) to learn more about the t-distribution and play around with t-distribution graphs.\n\n:::\n\nWhere $\\bar{X}$ is the sample mean,\n\n$t_{\\alpha/2, df}$ is the critical value for the t-distribution\nwith $df = n-1$,\n\n$S$ is the sample standard deviation,\n\nand $n$ is the sample size.\n\n::: column-margin\n\n**NOTE**: The t-distribution changes based on the degrees of freedom, approaching the normal distribution as the degrees of freedom increase.\n\n:::\n\nThe critical value for the t-distribution is determined by the confidence level and the degrees of freedom. This is calculated by finding the value of $t_{\\alpha/2, df}$ such that the area under the t-distribution curve (with that specific degrees of freedom) between $-t_{\\alpha/2, df}$ and $t_{\\alpha/2, df}$ is equal to the confidence level. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese critical values can be found using t-tables like the one below:\n\n![](t-table.png)\n\nFor a 95% confidence interval, our Type I error rate is $\\alpha = 0.05$. Since confidence intervals are two-tailed, we split this $\\alpha$ in half, half in the left tail and half in the right tail. This means that we are looking for $t_{.025, df}$ or $t_{.975, df}$.\n\n::: column-margin\n**NOTE**: A **Type I** error is when we reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true. This is also known as a false positive.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Exercise 1: t-distribution confidence intervals\"}\n\nThe table below shows summary data for the first round of the 2023 Masters tournament for amateur golfers. The critical value is for a 90% confidence interval with 6 degrees of freedom.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Sample           | Sample Mean| Sample Standard Deviation| Sample Size| Critical Value|\n|:----------------|-----------:|-------------------------:|-----------:|--------------:|\n|Amateurs Round 1 |          75|                   3.21455|           7|        1.94318|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUse the formula for creating a **confidence interval** using the t-distribution to calculate the upper and lower limits of a confidence interval for the true mean of amateur scoring using the amateurs in the first round as our sample.

What is the **interpretation** of this confidence interval?\n\n::: column-margin\n\n**TIP**: When interpreting a confidence interval do **not** say \"there is a 90% chance that the true mean is between the lower and upper bounds\". Instead, say \"we are 90% confident that the true mean is between the lower and upper bounds\".\n\n:::\n\n::: column-margin\n\n**TIP**: The t-table from earlier in the lesson will need to be used to find the critical value for the t-distribution for a 99% confidence interval with 6 degrees of freedom.\n:::\n\nRepeat this process with a 99% confidence interval ($\\alpha = .01$).\n\nd. What is the new **lower** bound of the confidence interval?\n\ne. What is the new **upper** bound of the confidence interval?\n\nf. Is this **99% confidence interval** larger, smaller, or the same as **90% confidence interval**?\n\ng. When thinking about your anwer to **f**, what do you think could explain this?\n\n:::\n\n## z-interval for single means\n\nA standard normal distribution (also known as a z-distribution) is used to calculate the confidence interval for a single mean if the sample size is large enough (greater than 30) or the population standard deviation is known. The first case is common as oftentimes samples are greater than 30. The second case is rare because it is uncommon to know the population standard deviation but not the population mean. \n\nThe formula for the confidence interval for a single mean using the z-distribution is very similar to that of the t-distribution\n\n::: column-margin\n\nClick [here](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/standard-normal-distribution/) for more information about the standard normal distribution.\n\n:::\n\n$CI = \\bar{X} \\pm Z_{\\alpha/2} \\times \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$ \n\nWhere $\\bar{X}$ is once again the sample mean,\n$Z_{\\alpha/2}$ is the critical value for the standard normal distribution at the specified confidence level, \n${\\sigma}$ is the population standard deviation, \nand $n$ is the sample size.\n\nThe reasoning behind why we can use the standard normal distribution when the sample is greater than 30 even if the population standard deviation is unknown is found in the [Central Limit Theorem](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/central-limit-theorem/), which says that as the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution. This means that when the sample size is greater than 30 we can use the sample standard deviation to estimate the population standard deviation and create a confidence interval as seen below\n\n$CI = \\bar{X} \\pm Z_{\\alpha/2} \\times \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}}$\n\nOnce again the critical value for the z-distribution is the value of $Z_{\\alpha/2}$ such that the area under the standard normal distribution curve between $-Z_{\\alpha/2}$ and $Z_{\\alpha/2}$ is equal to the confidence level.\n\nThe critical values for the z-distribution can be found using a z-table such as the one below. All values in the table are the area under the curve to the left of the z-score. \n\n![](z-table.png)\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Exercise 2: z-distribution confidence intervals\"}\n\nThe table below shows summary data for the first round of the 2023 Masters Tournament for PGA professional golfers.

Use a 95% confidence interval ($\\alpha = .05$).\n\na. Why can we use the **standard normal distribution** to calculate this confidence interval?\n\nb. What is the **confidence interval** for the true mean of scoring for PGA professionals at Augusta National?\n\nc. What is the **interpretation** of this confidence interval?\n\n:::\n\n# Hypothesis Testing with Single Mean Confidence Intervals\n\nHypothesis testing is a method used to determine if a claim about a population parameter is true or not. In this section, we will perform the most common type of hypothesis test, a single mean test. The null hypothesis ($H_0$) is that the population mean is equal to a specific value, and the alternative hypothesis ($H_a$) is that the population mean is not equal to that value, greater than that value, or less than that value.\n\nNull Hypothesis: $H_0: \\mu = \\mu_0$\n\nAlternative Hypothesis Options: \n\n$H_a: \\mu \\neq \\mu_0$ or\n\n$H_a: \\mu > \\mu_0$ or\n\n$H_a: \\mu < \\mu_0$\n\n\n## Test Statistics\n\nLike confidence intervals, we have two different tests for hypothesis testing for the population mean. Remember that if the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is less than 30, we use the t-distribution. If the population standard deviation is known or the sample size is greater than 30, we use the standard normal distribution.\n\nEach of these distributions have their own tests, the t-test and the z-test. This means that we have different test statistics to calculate depending on the situation.\n\n#### t-test\n\nThe t-test statistic is calculated using the formula:\n\n$$t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}}$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, $\\mu_0$ is the hypothesized population mean, $s$ is the sample standard deviation, and $n$ is the sample size.\n\n#### z-test\n\nThe z-test statistic is calculated using the formula:\n\n$$z = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}}$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, $\\mu_0$ is the hypothesized population mean, $\\sigma$ is the population standard deviation, and $n$ is the sample size.\n\n## To Reject or Fail to Reject\n\nThere are two ways to make a decision about the null hypothesis. \n\n**Method 1**: **Critical values**, along with **test statistics**, can be used to determine if the **hypothesized population mean** is within the **confidence interval** for the true mean.\n\nA **critical value** is a value that separates the rejection region from the non-rejection region. The rejection region is the area where the null hypothesis is rejected. The non-rejection region is the area where the null hypothesis is not rejected. The critical value is determined by the significance level ($\\alpha$) and the degrees of freedom (if it is a t-test). The critical value is compared to the test statistic to determine if the null hypothesis should be rejected. If the test statistic is within the non-rejection region, the null hypothesis is not rejected. If the test statistic is within the rejection region, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted.\n\nBelow is an example of using critical values and a test-statistic for a z-test with a 95% confidence level (two-sided). The critical value is 1.96. This means that if the test statistic is greater than 1.96 or less than -1.96, the null hypothesis is rejected. The blue represents the non-rejection region and the red the rejection region. Since the Test Statistic for this hypothetical example is 1.1 (less than 1.96 and greater than -1.96), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis method corresponds directly to the related confidence intervals produced for the sample data.\n\nIf the hypothesized population mean is within the confidence interval, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. If the hypothesized population mean is not within the confidence interval, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted.\n\n::: column-margin\n\n**Note**: We can say that there is significant evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis if the null hypothesis is rejected. However, it should never be said that we accept the null hypothesis. We can only fail to reject it.\n\n:::\n\n**Method 2**: The second method is to use a p-value. The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as the one calculated from the sample data given that the null hypothesis is true. The p-value is compared to the significance level ($\\alpha$) to determine if the null hypothesis should be rejected. If the p-value is less than $\\alpha$, the null hypothesis is rejected. If the p-value is greater than $\\alpha$, the null hypothesis is not rejected.\n\n::: column-margin\n**NOTE**: Our **alternative hypothesis** determines whether we are looking for the probability that the test statistic is greater than or less than the observed value. \n\n- For a **two-sided test**, the p-value is the probability that the test statistic is greater than the observed value or less than the negative of the observed value. Find the area in one of the tails and double it.\n\n- For a **left-tailed test** ($H_a: \\mu < \\mu_0$), the p-value is the probability that the test statistic is less than the observed value.\n\n- For a **right-tailed test** ($H_a: \\mu > \\mu_0$), the p-value is the probability that the test statistic is greater than the observed value.\n:::\n\nFor example, if the p-value for a single mean hypothesis test is 0.03 and the significance level is 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected because the p-value is less than the significance level.\n\n## Hypothesis testing example\n\nSuppose we have a sample of data with the following values: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100. We want to test if the true mean of the population is not equal to 50. Alpha is 0.05. Our hypotheses are as follows:\n\n- Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): $\\mu = 50$\n- Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$): $\\mu \\neq 50$\n\nWe can use the t-test to test this hypothesis. We start by finding the sample mean and sample standard deviation. The sample mean is 55 and the sample standard deviation is 30.2765. The degrees of freedom are 9. The critical value for a 95% two-sided confidence t-interval with 9 degrees of freedom is $\\pm 2.262157$. \n\nThe test statistic can be calculated as follows:\n\n$$t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}}$$\n$$t = \\frac{55 - 50}{\\frac{30.2765}{\\sqrt{10}}}$$\n$$t = 0.522$$\nSince the test statistic is between the two critical values, there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the true mean is not equal to 50.\n\nThe p-value for this example could be calculated by finding the area\nunder the curve to the left of -0.522 and to the right of 0.522. The p-value would be the sum of these two areas. By looking at the t-table, it can be seen that the sum of these two areas would be well greater than .5, which is greater than .05. Therefore, the null hypothesis would not be rejected.\n\n::: column-margin\n**NOTE**: Since this is a two-sided test you could simply find the probability that the test statistic is greater than 0.522 and multiply by 2. This would give you the **p-value**.\n:::\n\n## Hypothesizing Par as the Population Mean\n\n::: column-margin\n\nAugusta National is breathtakingly beautiful, but if golfers get distracted by the scenic views, tall pines, bunkers, water, and azaleas may catch their balls. \n\n![Augusta Hole 13](augusta-national-13.jpg)\n\nImage Source: [Your Golf Travel](https://www.yourgolftravel.com/golf-architects/alister-mackenzie-golf-courses), [CC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)\n\n:::\n\nIn golf par is considered to be the number of strokes a good golfer is expected to take.

Answer the following questions based on the sample.\n\n::: column-margin\n\n\n\n\n\n**Think on it**: The average score for the first 2 rounds of the 2023 Masters Tournament was 72.8, while the average score for the last 2 rounds was 73.22. This is interesting because only the top players make it to the last 2 rounds, so you would expect the scores to be lower. What could have changed so that the best players are now scoring worse?\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Sample           | Sample Mean| Sample Standard Deviation| Sample Size|\n|:----------------|-----------:|-------------------------:|-----------:|\n|PGA Rounds 1 & 2 |    72.26364|                  2.985215|         110|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\na. Create a **95% confidence interval** for the mean of the sample using a z-interval. What is the **confidence interval**?\n\nb. Create a **95% confidence interval** for the mean of the sample using a t-interval. What is the **confidence interval**?\n\nc. Which of the above confidence intervals is **wider**?\n\nd. Based on your answer to the above question, would you say a t-distribution has **heavier** or **lighter** tailed than a z-distribution?\n\ne. Is the difference in the **confidence intervals** in this problem likely to change a result in a hypothesis test? Why or why not?\n\n:::\n",
